<p>Summary 1:  Even if the building has been correctly placed according to SOUTH-FACING OUTDOORS and there is little outdoor space toward the north, there is usually still some kind of area or volume on the north face of the building.</p>
<p>Summary 2: Look at the north sides of the buildings which you know.</p>
<p>Summary 3: Make the north face of the building a cascade which slopes down to the ground, so that the sun which normally casts a long shadow to the north strikes the ground immediately beside the building.</p>
<p>Summary 4: If a building has a sheer north face, during many months of the year it will cast a long shadow out behind it....</p>
<p>Summary 5: If there are north rooms that are inevitably gloomy, it helps enormously to make a reflecting wall: a wall standing some ways to the north of the building, painted white or yellow, and set in a position which gets the sun and reflects it back into the building.</p>
<p>Summary 6: Use the triangle inside this north cascade for car, garbage, storage, shed, a studio which requires north light, closets - those parts of the building which can do very well without interior sunlight - CAR CONNECTION, BULK STORAGE, COMPOST, CLOSETS BETWEEN ROOMS..</p>
