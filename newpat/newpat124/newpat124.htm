<p>Summary 1:  In many large scale patterns which define public space, the edge is critical: PROMENADE, SMALL PUBLIC SQUARES, PUBLIC OUTDOOR ROOM, PEDESTRIAN STREET, BUILDING THOROUGHFARE, PATH SHAPE.</p>
<p>Summary 2: Surround public gathering places with pockets of activity - small, partly enclosed areas at the edges, which jut forward into the open space between the paths, and contain activities which make it natural for people to pause and get involved.</p>
<p>Summary 3: In more detail: people gravitate naturally toward the edge of public spaces.</p>
<p>Summary 4: If the edge does not provide them with places where it is natural to linger, the space becomes a place to walk through, not a place to stop.</p>
<p>Summary 5: The scalloped edge must surround the space entirely.</p>
<p>Summary 6: To make the space lively, the scalloped edge must surround the space completely..</p>
