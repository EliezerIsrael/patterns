<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p><i>I want to stand on the shoulders of giants and I want to stand on them NOW!</i></p>
<p><i>And not just any shoulders, but only on the shoulders of the giants who know all about the project I&apos;m working on right now!</i></p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Is this a tall order or what?</p>
<p>Well, what do the giants do that we really want?</p>
<p>They see patterns and then describe the patterns.</p>
<p>We just want the right set of patterns appropriate for the time and place.</p>
<p>This app is a first step towards helping you climb on shoulders and see what the giants see.</p>
<p>The current revision looks at the work of one giant - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Alexander" target="_blank">Christopher Alexander</a> and one work - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Pattern_Language" target="_blank">A Pattern Language</a> - and summarizes and categorizes each pattern.</p>
<p>In many ways the app is trivial. All it does is to simplify simplicity.</p>
<p>On the other hand (shoulder?), the work is of interest because it is produced through the use of computer programming - essential data has been abstracted and extracted from the original work almpost entirely by algorithm.</p>
<p>Furthermore a new set of data has been created - including summaries, tags and links - by algorithm. This material can be used to for proof-checking and further evidence gathering.</p>
<p>The next (quite big) step is to carry out similar processes on the works of other giants. Possibilities include <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrea_Palladio" target="_blank">Andrea Palladio</a>'s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Quattro_Libri_dell%27Architettura" target="_blank"><i>I quattro libri dell'architettura</i></a> and the OSHA <a href="http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owasrch.search_form?p_doc_type=STANDARDS&p_toc_level=1&p_keyvalue=Construction" target="_blank">regulations for construction</a>.</p>
<p>The eventual idea is that you will enter in a tag such as 'window' and you are provided by the guidance of a good number of big thinkers who can clearly see through the window.</p>
<p>The issue with standing on shoulders is that it can be easy to fall off. Typical causes might include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Program-generated data has to mix with mechanical-Turk data with crowd-sourced data with domain-expert data</li>
<li>Full revision control for every aspect of the app</li>
<li>Ease of user experience</li>
<li>Openness and peer-review capabilities</li>
<li>Support for varying varieties of tagging and taxonomies and ontologies</li>
<li>Playing nice with intellectual property issues</li>
</ul>

<p>Where are the shoulders of the giants on what I have written here?</p>
<p>Who well considers the patterns of patterns?</p>
