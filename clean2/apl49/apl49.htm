<h1>49 LOOPED LOCAL ROADS</h1>
<p>. . . assume that neighborhoods, house clusters, work communities, and major roads are more or less defined - <a href="../apl11/apl11.htm">LOCAL TRANSPORT AREAS (11)</a>, <a href="../apl14/apl14.htm">IDENTIFIABLE NEIGHRORHOOD (14)</a>, <a href="../apl23/apl23.htm">PARALLEL ROADS (23)</a>, <a href="../apl37/apl37.htm">HOUSE CLUSTER (37)</a>, <a href="../apl41/apl41.htm">WORK COMMUNITY (41)</a>. Now, for the layout of the local roads.

<p>Nobody wants fast through traffic going by their homes.</p>
<p>Therefore:</p>
<p>Lay out local roads so that they form loops. A loop is defined as any stretch of road which makes it impossible for cars that don't have destinations on it to use it as a shortcut. Do not allow any one loop to serve more than 50 cars, and keep the road really narrow - 17 to 20 feet is quite enough.</p>

<p>Make all the junctions between local roads three-way T junctions, never four-way intersections - <a href="../apl50/apl50.htm">T JUNCTIONS (50)</a>; wherever there is any possibility of life from buildings being oriented toward the road, give the road a very rough surface of grass and gravel, with paving stones for wheels of cars - <a href="../apl51/apl51.htm">GREEN STREETS (51)</a>; keep parking off the road in driveways - <a href="../apl103/apl103.htm">SMALL PARKING LOTS (103)</a> and <a href="../apl113/apl113.htm">CAR CONNECTION (113)</a>; except where the roads are very quiet, run pedestrian paths at right angles to them, not along them, and make buildings open off these paths, not off the roads - <a href="../apl52/apl52.htm">NETWORK OF PATHS AND CARS (52)</a>. . . .</p>
