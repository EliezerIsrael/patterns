{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"16 WEB OF PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION","sm_api_content":" Create incentives so that all the different modes of public transportation - airplanes, helicopters, ferries, boats, trains, rapid transit, buses, mini-buses, skilifts, escalators, travelators, elevator - plan their lines to connect the interchanges, with the hope that gradually many different lines, of many different types, will meet at every interchange. Give the local communities control over their interchanges so that they can implement the pattern by giving contracts only to those transportation companies which are willing to serve these interchanges. We propose the opposite: namely, that interchanges are primary and that the transport lines are secondary elements which connect the interchanges. The interchange chief coordinates the service at his interchange; he charters service from any number of transport companies - the companies, themselves, are in free competition with one another to create service. The interchanges are responsible for connecting themselves to each other, and the community which uses the interchange decides what kinds of service they want to have passing through it. Keep all the various lines that converge on a single interchange, and their parking, within 600 feet, so that people can transfer on foot - INTERCHANGE.","sm_api_keyword_array":["interchange","public","transportation","lines","system"]}
