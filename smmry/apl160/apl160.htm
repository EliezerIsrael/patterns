{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"160 BUILDING EDGE","sm_api_content":" A building is most often thought of as something which turns inward - toward its rooms. People do not often think of a building as something which must also be oriented toward the outside. Crenelate the edge of buildings with places that invite people to stop. Unless the building is oriented toward the outside, which surrounds it, as carefully and positively as toward its inside, the space around the building will be useless and blank - with the direct effect, in the long run, that the building will be socially isolated, because you have to cross a no-man&#039;s land to get to it. The machine-like building is cut off from its surroundings, isolated, an island. The building with a lively building edge, is connected, part of the social fabric, part of the town, part of the lives of all the people who live and move around it.","sm_api_keyword_array":["building","People","Place","edge","SPACE"]}
