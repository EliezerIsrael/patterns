To live life to the fullest, in each of the seven ages, each age must be clearly marked, by the community, as a distinct wellmarked time. B. Growth from one stage to another is not inevitable, and it will not happen unless the community contains a balanced life cycle. Integrity vs. despair:old age; the relationship between a person and his world, his kind, mankind; the achievement of wisdom; love for oneself and one&#039;s kind; to face death openly, with the forces of one&#039;s life integrated; vs. the despair that life has been useless. Persons at each stage of life have something irreplaceable to give and to take from the community, and it is just these transactions which help a person to solve the problems that beset each stage. To re-create a community of balanced life cycles requires, first of all, that the idea take its place as a principal guide in the development of communities.","sm_api_keyword_array":["life","community","each","cycle","age"]}
