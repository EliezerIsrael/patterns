{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"27 MEN AND WOMEN","sm_api_content":" Just as a community or neighborhood must have a proper balance of activities for people of all the different ages - COMMUNITY OF 7000, IDENTIFIABLE NEIGHBORHOOD, LIFE CYCLE - so it must also adjust itself and its activities to the balance of the sexes, and provide, in equal part, the things which reflect the masculine and feminine sides of life. Suburbs are for women, workplaces for men; kindergartens are for women, professional schools for men; supermarkets are for women, hardware stores for men. Schools for young children are swayed by the world of women, as are homes. In short, until both men and women are able to mutually influence each part of a town&#039;s life, we shall not know what kinds of physical patierns will best co-exist with this social order. No large housing areas without workshops for men; no work communities which do not provide for women with part-time jobs and child care - SCATTERED WORK. Within each place which has a balance of the masculine and feminine.","sm_api_keyword_array":["women","men","masculine","balance","community"]}
