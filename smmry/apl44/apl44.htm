{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"44 LOCAL TOWN HALL","sm_api_content":" According to COMMUNITY OF 7000, the political and economic life of the city breaks down into small, self-governing communities. Local government of communities and local control by the inhabitants, will only happen if each community has its own physical town hall which forms the nucleus of its political activity. To make the political control of local functions real, establish a small town hall for each community of 7000, and even for each neighborhood; locate it near the busiest intersection in the community. We have argued, in MOSAlC OF SUBCUtTURES, COMMUNITY OF 7000, and IDENTIFIABLE NEIGHBORHOOD, that every city needs to be made of self-governing groups, which exist at two different levels, the communities with populations of 5000 to 10,000 and the neighborhoods with populations of 200 to 1000. When we translate the idea of community organization and community territory into physical terms, they yield two components: an arena and a zone of community projects. The community needs a public forum, equipped with sound system, benches, walls to put up notices, where people are free to gather; a place which belongs to the community where people would naturally come whenever they think something should be done about something.","sm_api_keyword_array":["COMMUNITY","hall","people","neighborhood","city"]}
