{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"234 LAPPED OUTSIDE WALLS","sm_api_content":" The main function of a building&#039;s outside wall is to keep weather out. Build up the exterior wall surface with materials that are lapped against the weather: either &quot;Internally lapped,&quot; like exterior plaster, or more literally lapped, like shingles and boards and tiles. In either case, choose a material that is easy to repair in little patches, inexpensively, so that little by little, the wall can be maintained in good condition indefinitely. All of these walls are made of many small elements, so that individual pieces can be replaced as they are damaged or wear out. Bear in mind then, as you choose an exterior wall finish, that it should be a material which can be easily lapped against the weather, which is made of elements that are easy to repair locally, and which therefore can be maintained piecemeal, indefinitely. Slate, corrugated iron, ceramic tiles will produce excellent shingled wall claddings, and can all be placed in such a way as to provide exterior formwork for the pouring of a wall.","sm_api_keyword_array":["WALL","lapped","material","exterior","easy"]}
