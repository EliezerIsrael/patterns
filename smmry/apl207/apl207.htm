{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"207 GOOD MATERIALS","sm_api_content":" The central problem of materials is to find a collection of materials which are small in scale, easy to cut on site, easy to work on site without the aid of huge and expensive machinery, easy to vary and adapt, heavy enough to be solid, longlasting or easy to maintain, and yet easy to build, not needing specialized labor, not expensive in labor, and universally obtainable and cheap. We start with what we call &quot;Bulk materials&quot; - the materials that occur in the greatest volume in a given building. We shall therefore look upon wood as a precious material, which should not be used as a bulk material or for structural purposes. Beyond the bulk materials, there are the materials used in relatively smaller quantities for framework, surfaces, and finishes. When buildings are built with manageable secondary materials, they can be repaired with the same materials: repair becomes continuous with the original building. What are the good secondary materials? Wood, which we want to avoid as a bulk material, is excellent as a secondary material for doors, finishes, windows, furniture.","sm_api_keyword_array":["material","build","Use","Concrete","easy"]}
