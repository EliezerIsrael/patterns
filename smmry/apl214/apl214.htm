{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"214 ROOT FOUNDATIONS","sm_api_content":" Once you have a rough column plan for the building - COLUMNS AT THE CORNERS, FINAL COLUMN DISTRIBUTION - you are ready to start the site work itself. First, stake out the positions of the ground floor columns, before you do any other earthwork, so that you can move the columns whenever necessary to leave rocks or plants intact - SITE REPAIR, CONNECTION TO THE EARTH. Try to find a way of making foundations in which the columns themselves go right into the earth, and spread out there - so that the footing is continuous with the material of the column, and the column, with its footing, like a tree root, can resist tension and horizontal shear as well as compression. When the column and the foundations are separate elements which have to be connected, the connection becomes a difficult and critical joint. Since columns start out hollow, BOX COLUMNS, we can form a root foundation by setting the hollow column into the foundation pit, and then pouring the lower part of the column and the foundation, integrally, in a single pour. To make foundations like this for hollow concrete, filled box columns, start with a pit for each foundation, place the&#039;hollow column in the pit, and pour the column and the foundation integrally, in one continuous pour - BOX COLUMNS.","sm_api_keyword_array":["column","foundation","ground","work","root"]}
