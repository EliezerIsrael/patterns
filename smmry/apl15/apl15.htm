Of course, the few neighborhood shops there are - the STREET CAFE, the CORNER GROCERY - will help to form the edge of the neighborhood, but by and large the boundary of neighborhoods will have to come from a completely different morphological principle. From observations of neighborhoods that succeed in being well defined, both physically and in the minds of the townspeople, we have learned that the single most important feature of a neighborhood&#039;s boundary is restricted access into the neighborhood: neighborhoods that are successfully defined have definite and relatively few paths and roads leading into them. The result is that people do not come into the neighborhood by car unless they have business there; and when people are in the neighborhood, they recognize that they are in a distinct part of town. If each neighborhood is a self-contained entity, then the community of 7000 which the neighborhoods belong to will not control any of the land internal to the neighborhoods. The easiest way of all to form a boundary around a neighborhood is by turning buildings inward, and by cutting off the paths which cross the boundary, except for one or two at special points which become gateways MAIN GATEWAYS; the public land of the boundary may include a park, collector roads, small parking lots, and work communities anything which forms a natural edge PARALLEL ROADS, WORK COMMUNITY, QUlET BACKS, ACCESSIBLE GREEN, SHIELDED PARKING, SMALL PARKING LOTS.","sm_api_keyword_array":["NEIGHBORHOOD","boundary","STREET","cell","gateways"]}
