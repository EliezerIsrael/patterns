{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"236 WINDOWS WHICH OPEN WIDE","sm_api_content":" Many buildings nowadays have no opening windows at all; and many of the opening windows that people do build, don&#039;t do the job that opening windows ought to do. It is becoming the rule in modern design to seal up windows and create &quot;Perfect&quot; indoor climates with mechanical air conditioning systems. Double-hung windows cannot be fully opened - only half of the total window area can ever be opened at once. Sliding windows have much, of the same problem - only part of the window area can be open, since one panel goes behind another; and they often get stuck too. The old time French windows are a stunning example of this pattern. They are narrow, full length upstairs windows, which swing out onto a tiny balcony, large enough only to contain the open windows.","sm_api_keyword_array":["window","opened","air","open","too"]}
