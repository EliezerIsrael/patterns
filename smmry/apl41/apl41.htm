{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"41 WORK COMMUNITY","sm_api_content":" According to the pattern SCATTERED WORK, work is entirely decentralized and woven in and out of housing areas. The effect of SCATTERED WORK - can be increased piecemeal, by building individual work communities, one by one, in the boundaries between the neighborhoods; these work communities will then help to form the boundaries - SUBCULTURE BOUNDARY, NEIGHBORHOOD BOUNDARY - and above all in the boundaries, they will help to form ACTIVITY NODES. Anyone who uses the phrase &quot;Where do you live&quot; in its everyday sense, accepts as his own the widespread cultural awareness of the fact that no one really &quot;Lives&quot; at his place of work - there is no song or music there, no love, no food - that he is not alive while working, not living, only toiling away, and being dead. As soon as we understand this situation it leads at once to outrage. If a person spends eight hours a day working in a certain area, and the nature of his work, its social character, and its location, are all chosen to make sure that he is living, not merely earning money, then it is certainly essential that the area immediately around his place of work be a community, just like a neighborhood but oriented to the pace and rhythms of work, instead of the rhythms of the family. The communities need to be small enough so that one can know most of the people working in them, at least by sight - and big enough to support as many amenities for the workers as possible - lunch counters, local sports, shops, and so on. A work community, though forming a core community by itself, cannot work well in complete isolation from the surrounding community.","sm_api_keyword_array":["WORK","community","Live","workplace","people"]}
