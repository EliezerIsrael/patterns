{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"227 COLUMN CONNECTIONS","sm_api_content":" The columns are in position, and have been tied together by a perimeter bearm - BOX COLUMNS, PERIMETER BEAMS. According to the principles of continuity which govern the basic structure - EFFICIENT STRUCTURE, the connections need stiffening to lead the forces smoothly from the beams into the columns, especially when the columns are free standing as they are in an arcade or balcony - ARCADE, GALLERY SURROUND, SIX-FOOT BALCONY, COLUMN PLACE. Any distribution of material which fills the corner up will do: fillets, gussets, column capitals, mushroom column, and most general of all, the arch, which connects column and beam in a continuous curve. A column connection will work best when it acts both as a column capital and as a column brace. A similar column connection can be made integral with poured hollow columns and beams. Of course, typical column capitals - a larger stone on a stone column or typical gusset plate or brace - even if weak in some ways, also help a great deal.","sm_api_keyword_array":["COLUMN","connection","force","beam","frame"]}
