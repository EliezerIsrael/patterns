{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"64 POOLS AND STREAMS","sm_api_content":" We came from the water; our bodies are largely water; and water plays a fundamental role in our psychology. Even in the temperate climates that are water rich, the natural sources of water are dried up, hidden, covered, lost. Water to swim in, water to sit beside, water where you can dangle your feet. We can locate local reservoirs and distribution reservoirs so that people can get at them; we might build them as kinds of shrines, where people can come to get in touch with the source of their water supply; the place immediately around the water an atmosphere inviting contemplation. Where there is a gap, where nourishing contact with water is missing, then each project should make some attempt, on its own and in combination with other projects, to bring some water into the environment. There is no other way to build up an adequate texture of water in cities: we need pools for swimming, ornamental and natural pools, streams of rain water, fountains, falls, natural brooks and streams running through towns, tiny garden pools, and reservoirs we can get to and appreciate.","sm_api_keyword_array":["WATER","pools","stream","run","natural"]}
