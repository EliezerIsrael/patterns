{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"97 SHIELDED PARKING","sm_api_content":" Many patterns we have given discourage dependence on the use of cars; we hope that these patterns will gradually get rid, altogether, of the need for large parking lots and parking structures - LOCAL TRANSPORT AREAS, NINE PER CENT PARKING. Put all large parking lots, or parking garages, behind some kind of natural wall, so that the cars and parking structures cannot be seen from outside. Make the entrance to the parking lot a natural gateway to the buildings which it serves, and place it so that you can easily see the main entrance to the building from the entrance to the parking. In certain cases it is still necessary to build larger parking lots or parking structures. Along with the need to shield parking structures there is the equally pressing need on the part of a driver to be able to spot the parking structure quickly - and see how it is connected to the building he is headed for. One of the most frequent complaints about the parking near a building is not that it is too far away, but that you don&#039;t know where you can go to find a parking spot and still be sure of how to get back into the building.","sm_api_keyword_array":["parked","build","structure","entrance","lot"]}
