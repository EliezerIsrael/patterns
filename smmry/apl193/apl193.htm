{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"193 HALF-OPEN WALL","sm_api_content":" Wherever there are HALF-PRIVATE OFFICES, SIX-FOOT BALCONIES, ALCOVES, SITTING CIRCLES, BED ALCOVES, BUILDING THOROUGHFARES, ARCADES, or THE FLOW THROUGH ROOMS, the spaces must be given a subtle balance of enclosure and openness by partly opening up the walls or keeping them half-open. Adjust the walls, openings, and windows in each indoor space until you reach the right balance between open, flowing space and closed cell-like space. Do not take it for granted that each space is a room; nor, on the other hand, that all spaces must flow into each other. The kind of space which most easily supports both differentiation of activities and the transition between different activities has less enclosure than a solid room, and more enclosure - far more - than a space inside an open plan. A wall which is half-open, half-enclosed - an arch, a trellised wall, a wall that is counter height with ornamented columns, a wall suggested by the reduction of the opening or the enlargemerit of the columns at the corners, a colonnade of columns in the wall - all these help get the balance of enclosure and openness right; and in these places people feel comfortable as a result. Wherever a small space is in a larger space, yet slightly separate from it, make the wall between the two about half-open and half-solid - ALCOVES, WORKSPACE ENCLOSURE.","sm_api_keyword_array":["SPACE","wall","room","enclosure","COLUMN"]}
