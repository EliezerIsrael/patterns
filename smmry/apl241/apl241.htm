We made random spot checks on selected benches in Berkeley, California, and recorded these facts about each bench: Was it occupied or empty? Did it give a view of current activity or not? Was it in the sun or not? What was the current wind velocity? Three of the eleven benches were occupied; eight were empty. At the moment of observation, all three occupied benches looked onto activity, were in the sun, and had a wind velocity of less than 1-5 feet per second. Three of them had shelter and activity but no sun; three of them had activity but no sun, and wind greater than 3 feet per second; two of them had sun and shelter but no activity. If these seats can be made continuous with stairs or building entrances or low walls or ballustrades, so much the better - STAIR SEATS, FRONT DOOR BENCH, SITTING WALL....","sm_api_keyword_array":["bench","sun","build","SEAT","ACTIVITY"]}
