{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"142 SEQUENCE OF SITTING SPACES","sm_api_content":" Put in a sequence of graded sitting spaces throughout the building, varying according to their degree of enclosure. To solve the problem, recognize that your building should contain a sequence of sitting spaces of varying degrees of intimacy, and that each space in this sequence needs the degree of enclosure and comfort appropriate to its position. Of course, you may want to build a special sitting room - a sala or a parlor or a library or a living room - as one of the sitting spaces in your house. Pick the sequence of sitting spaces quite deliberately, mark it, and pay equal attention to the various spaces in the sequence as you go further into the details of the design. Put the most formal sitting spaces in the COMMON AREAS AT THE HEART and in the ENTRANCE ROOM ; put the intermediate spaces also in the COMMON AREAS AT THE HEART, in FLEXIBLE OFFICE SPACE, in a PLACE TO WAIT, and on the PRIVATE TERRACE ON THE STREET ; and put the most intimate and most informal sitting spaces in the COUPLE&#039;S REALM, the FARMHOUSE KITCHEN, the ROOMS OF ONE&#039;S OWN, and the HALF-PRIVATE OFFICES. Build the enclosure round each space, according to its position in the scale of sitting spaces - THE SHAPE OF INDOOR SPACE; and make each one, wherever it is, comfortable and lazy by placing chairs correctly with respect to fires and windows - ZEN VIEW, WINDOW PLACE, THE FIRE, SITTING CIRCLE, SEAT SPOTS....","sm_api_keyword_array":["space","sitting","room","build","sequence"]}
