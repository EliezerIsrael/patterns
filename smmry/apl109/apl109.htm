{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"109 LONG THIN HOUSE","sm_api_content":" In such a house or office there are strong reasons to make the building even longer and thinner still. These shapes increase the separation between places inside the building and therefore increase the relative privacy which people are able to get within a given area. A small building can actually be much narrower than people imagine. We have seen successful buildings as narrow as 12 feet wide - indeed, Richard Neutra&#039;s own house in Los Angeles is even less. A building which is 12 feet square, and three stories high, with an exterior stair, makes a wonderful house. Use the long thin plan to help shape outdoor space on the site - POSITIVE OUTDOOR SPACE; the long perimeter of the building sets the stage for INTIMACY GRADIENT and for the CASCADE OF ROOFS.","sm_api_keyword_array":["building","house","shape","narrow","long"]}
