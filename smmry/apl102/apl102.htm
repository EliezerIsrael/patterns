{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"102 FAMILY OF ENTRANCES","sm_api_content":" CIRCULATION REALMS portrayed a series of realms, in a large building or a building complex, with a major entrance or gateway into each realm and a collection of minor doorways, gates, and openings off each realm. When a person arrives in a complex of offices, or services or workshops, or in a group of related houses, there is a good chance he will experience confusion unless the whole collection is laid out before him, so that he can see the entrance of the place where he is going. In these cases we specified one clearly defined main entrance, with main reception clearly visible inside this main entrance and each &quot;Next&quot; point of reception then visible from the previous one, so that a patient who might be frightened or confused could find his way about by asking receptionists - and could always be directed to the next, visible receptionist down the line. Within the indoor streets, the entrance to each service was made in a similar way - each one bulged out slightly into the street, so that people could easily find their way around among the resulting family of entrances. A person who is looking for one of several entrances, and doesn&#039;t know his way around, needs to have some simple way of identifying the one entrance he wants. In detail, make the entrances bold and easy to see - MAIN ENTRANCE ; when they lead into private domains, houses and the like, make a transition in between the, public street and the inside - ENTRANCE TRANSITION; and shape the entrance itself as a room, which straddles the wall, and is thus both inside and outside as a projecting volume, covered and protected from the rain and sun - ENTRANCE ROOM.","sm_api_keyword_array":["entrance","pattern","visible","each","way"]}
