{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"54 ROAD CROSSING","sm_api_content":" Under the impetus of PARALLEL ROADS and NETWORK OF PATHS AND CARS, paths will gradually grow at right angles to major roads - not along them as they do now. At any point where a pedestrian path crosses a road that has enough traffic to create more than a two second delay to people crossing, make a &quot;Knuckle&quot; at the crossing: narrow the road to the width of the through lanes only; continue the pedestrian path through the crossing about a foot above the roadway; put in islands between lanes; slope the road up toward the crossing; mark the path with a canopy or shelter to make it visible. The people who cross a road will only feel comfortable and safe if the road crossing is a physical obstruction, which physically guarantees that the cars must slow down and give way to pedestrians. The same principle applies, even more powerfully, where pedestrians have to cross a road. The pedestrians who cross must be extremely visible from the road. Cars should also be forced to slow down when they approach the crossing. To make the crossing even easier to see from a distance and to give weight to the pedestrian&#039;s right to be there, the pedestrian path could be marked by a canopy at the edge of the road - CANVAS ROOFS. On one side or the other of the road make the pedestrian path swell out to form a tiny square, where food stands cluster round a bus stop - SMALL PUBLIC SQUARES, BUS STOP, FOOD STANDS; provide one or two bays for standing space for buses and cars - SMALL PARKING LOTS, and when a path must run from the road crossing along the side of the road, keep it to one side only, make it as wide as possible, and raised above the roadway - RAISED WALK.","sm_api_keyword_array":["road","cross","pedestrian","path","car"]}
