{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"104 SITE REPAIR","sm_api_content":" The most general aspects of a building complex are established in BUILDING COMPLEX, NUMBER OF STORIES, and CIRCULATION REALMS. What usually happens when someone thinks of building on a piece of land? He looks for the best site - where the grass is most beautiful, the trees most healthy, the slope of the land most even, the view most lovely, the soil most fertile - and that is just where he decides to put his house. When the construction starts on the parts of the land which are already healthy, innumerable beauties are wiped out with every act of building. If we always build on that part of the land which is most healthy, we can be virtually certain that a great deal of the land will always be less than healthy. We must treat every new act of building as an opportunity to mend some rent in the existing cloth; each act of building gives us the chance to make one of the ugliest and least healthy parts of the environment more healthy - as for those parts which are already healthy and beautiful - they of course need no attention. Above all, leave trees intact and build around them with great care - TREE PLACES; keep open spaces open to the south of buildings, for the sun -SOUTH FACING OUTDOORS; try, generally, to shape space in such a way that each place becomes positive, in its own right - POSITIVE OUTDOOR SPACE.","sm_api_keyword_array":["build","land","healthy","part","place"]}
