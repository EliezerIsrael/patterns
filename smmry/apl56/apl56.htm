Build a system of paths designated as bike paths, with the following properties: the bike paths are marked clearly with a special, easily recognizable surface. Where a bike path runs along a local road, its surface may be, level with the road - if possible, on the sunny side; where a bike path runs along a pedestrian path, keep it separate from that path and a few inches below it. Bikes endanger pedestrians along pedestrian paths; yet people often tend to ride bikes along pedestrian paths, not roads, because they are the shortest routes. Where bike paths run alongside local roads, parking should be removed from that side of the road; the bike surface may simply be part of the road and level with it. Build the racks for bikes to one side of the main entrance, so that the bikes don&#039;t interfere with people&#039;s natural movement in and out - MAIN ENTRANCE, and give it some shelter, with the path from the racks to the entrance also under shelter - ARCADES ; keep the bikes out of quiet walks and quiet gardens - QUIET BACKS, GARDEN WALL ....","sm_api_keyword_array":["bike","path","road","pedestrian","ride"]}
