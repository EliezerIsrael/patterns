{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"223 DEEP REVEALS","sm_api_content":" Windows with a sharp edge where the frame meets the wall create harsh, blinding glare, and make the rooms they serve uncomfortable. Make the window frame a deep, splayed edge: about a foot wide and splayed at about 50 to 60 degrees to the plane of the window, so that the gentle gradient of daylight gives a smooth transition between the light of the window and the dark of the inner wall. A window is always much brighter than an interior wall; and the walls tend to be darkest next to the window&#039;s edge. The splayed reveal then creates a transition area - a zone of intermediate brightness - between the brightness of, the window and the darkness of the wall. In empirical studies of glare, Hopkinson and Petherbridge have found: that the larger the reveal is, the less glare there is; the reveal functions best, when its brightness is just halfway between the brightness of the window and the brightness of the wall. Build the depth of the frame so that it is continuous with the structure of the walls - FRAMES AS THICKENED EDGES; if the wall is thin, make up the necessary depth for the reveal on the inside face of the wall, with bookshelves, closets or other THICK WALLS; embellish the edge of the window even further, to make light even softer, with lace work, tracery, and climbing plants - FILTERED LIGHT, HALF-INCH TRIM, CLIMBING PLANTS....","sm_api_keyword_array":["window","wall","reveal","edge","glare"]}
