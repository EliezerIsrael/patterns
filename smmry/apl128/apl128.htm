{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"128 INDOOR SUNLIGHT","sm_api_content":" From INTIMACY GRADIENT, You have some idea of the overall distribution of public and private rooms within the building. If the right rooms are facing south, a house is bright and sunny and cheerful; if the wrong rooms are facing south, the house is dark and gloomy. Place the most important rooms along the south edge of the building, and spread the building out along the east-west axis. Fine tune the arrangement so that the proper rooms are exposed to the south-east and the south-west sun. Think of the rooms you know which do have sunshine in them, and compare them with the many rooms you know that don&#039;t. When you can, open up these indoor sunny rooms to the outdoors, and build a sunny place and outdoor rooms directly outside - SUNNY PLACE, OUTDOOR ROOM, WINDOWS WHICH OPEN WIDE.","sm_api_keyword_array":["room","build","sun","SOUTH","sunny"]}
