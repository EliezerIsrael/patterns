To be in touch with water, we must above all be able to swim; and to swim daily, the pools and ponds and holes for swimming must be so widely scattered through the city, that each person can reach one within minutes. We have already explained, in POOLS AND STREAMS, how important it is to be in touch with water - and how the ordinary water of an area can, if left open, be a natural component of the everyday ecology of a community. On the one hand, Adults cannot have any substantial contact with water unless they can swim in it, and for this purpose the body of water must be large enough and deep enough to swim in. The human consequences of this transition are important: it means that people can walk lazily along the edge, without concern for their safety; they can sit at the edge and have their feet in the water, or walk along with the water around their ankles. Of course, some deep water is essential for swimming; but the edge of the deep water must not be directly accessible.","sm_api_keyword_array":["WATER","swim","pool","edge","deep"]}
