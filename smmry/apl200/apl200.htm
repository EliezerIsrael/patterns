{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"200 OPEN SHELVES","sm_api_content":" Cover the walls with narrow shelves of varying depth but always shallow enough so that things can be placed on them one deep - nothing hiding behind anything else. In badly planned kitchens, the shelves are filled with things three or four items deep, sometimes stacked on top of each other, and something is always in the way of what you need. In wellplanned kitchens, all storage is one item deep. Shelves are one can deep, glasses arc stored one row deep, pots and pans are hung one deep on the wall; for small jars and spices there are special spice shelves that hold the items just one deep. Openly stored, one deep, these things are beautiful around the house. Mark the open shelves along with all the other deep spaces in the walls - THICKENING THE OUTER WALL....","sm_api_keyword_array":["deep","shelves","storage","things","wall"]}
