{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"114 HIERARCHY OF OPEN SPACE","sm_api_content":" The main outdoor spaces are given their character by SITE REPAIR, SOUTH FACING OUTDOORS and POSITIVE OUTDOOR SPACE. You can refine them, and complete their character by making certain that every space always has a view out into some other larger one, and that all the spaces work together to form hierarchies. Outdoors, people always try to find a spot where they can have their backs protected, looking out toward some larger opening, beyond the space immediately in front of them. Whatever space you are shaping - whether it is a garden, terrace, street, park, public outdoor room, or courtyard, make sure of two things. In the very smallest of outdoor spaces, in private gardens, this pattern tells you to make a corner of the space as a &quot;Back&quot; with a seat, looking out on the garden. Slightly larger in scale, there is the connection between a terrace or an outdoor room of some kind and a larger open space, the street or a square.","sm_api_keyword_array":["SPACE","garden","larger","outdoor","back"]}
