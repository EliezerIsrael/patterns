{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"59 QUIET BACKS","sm_api_content":" Give the buildings in the busy parts of town a quiet &quot;Back&quot; behind them and away from the noise. The walk along the Seine, through the middle of Paris, is a classic &quot;Quiet back&quot; in the middle of a fast city. A beautiful case is the University of Cambridge: each college has its &quot;Backs&quot; - quiet courts stretching down to the River Cam. The need for quiet backs goes far beyond the university. If the front is given over to the street life, cars, shopping paths, delivery - then the back can be reserved for quiet. If the back is to be quiet, a place where you can hear only natural sounds - winds, birds, water - it is critical that it be protected.","sm_api_keyword_array":["quiet","Back","Build","walk","where"]}
