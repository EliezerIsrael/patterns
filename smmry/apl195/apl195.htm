{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"195 STAIRCASE VOLUME","sm_api_content":" STAIRCASE AS A STAGE and OPEN STAIRS will tell you roughly where to place the various stairs, both indoors and outdoors. The stair may be 2 feet wide or 5 feet wide for a generous shallow stair. As you work out the exact slope of your stair, bear in mind the relationship: riser + tread=17. Obviously, these stairs will not work; and the misunderstandings of the nature of the stair are so basic, that it is hard to correct these plans without destroying them. In some cases - a very small house, a stair to the roof - such a shallow stair is a waste of space; a steep stair is far more appropriate. Construct the staircase as a vault, within a space defined by columns, just like every other room - COLUMNS AT THE CORNERS, STAIR VAULT.","sm_api_keyword_array":["stair","slope","STAIRCASE","more","work"]}
