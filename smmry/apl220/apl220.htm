{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"220 ROOF VAULTS","sm_api_content":" If the roof is a flat ROOF GARDEN, it can be built just like any FLOOR-CEILING VAULT. Build the roof vault either as a cylindrical barrel vault, or like a pitched roof with a slight convex curve in each of the two sloping sides. The roof must definitely contain lived-in space - that is, not just sit on top of the rooms which are all below - see SHELTERING ROOF. Flat roofs, except ROOF GARDENS, are already eliminated by the psychological arguments of SHELTERING ROOFS and, of course, by structural considerations. These roofs enclose habitable space more efficiently than pitched roofs; but they have the same structural drawbacks. We have developed a range of roof vaults which are rather similar to a pitched roof - but with a convex curve great enough to eliminate bending, in some cases actually approaching barrel vaults.","sm_api_keyword_array":["roof","VAULT","material","shape","pitch"]}
