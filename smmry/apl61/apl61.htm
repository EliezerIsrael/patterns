{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"61 SMALL PUBLIC SQUARES","sm_api_content":" Make a public square much smaller than you would at first imagine; usually no more than 45 to 60 feet across, never more than 70 feet across. When the diameter gets above 70 feet, the squares begin to seem deserted and unpleasant. The only exceptions we know are places like the Piazza San Marco and Trafalgar Square, which are great town centers, teeming with people. What possible functional basis is there for these observations? First, we know from the pattern, PEDESTRIAN DENSITY, that a place begins to seem deserted when it has more than about 300 square feet per person. Since there are far far better chances Of 4 or 12 people being in a certain place than 33, the smaller squares will feel comfortable for a far greater percentage of the time. An even better estimate for the size of the square: make a guess about the number of people who will typically be there, and make the area of the square no greater than 150 to 300P square feet - PEDESTRIAN DENSITY; ring the square around with pockets of activity where people congregate - ACTIVITY POCKETS ; build buildings round the square in such a way that they give it a definite shape, with views out into other larger places - POSITIVE OUTDOOR SPACE, HIERARCHY OF OPEN SPACE, BUILDING FRONTS, STAIR SEATS; and to make the center of the square as useful as the edges, build SOMETHING ROUGHLY IN THE MIDDLE....","sm_api_keyword_array":["square","feet","people","place","public"]}
