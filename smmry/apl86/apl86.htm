When we look at the children&apos;s needs, and at the needs of the adults, we realize that what is needed is a new institution in the neighborhood: a children&apos;s home - a place where children can be safe and well looked after, night and day, with the full range of opportunities and social activities that can introduce them, fully, to society. 141-42). The children&apos;s home we propose is a place which &quot;De-intensifies the parent-child relationship&quot; by bringing the child into authentic social relationships with several other adults and many other children. Silverstein has indicated that the child&apos;s sense of his first school being &quot;Separate&quot; from society can be reduced if the play areas of the children&apos;s home are open to all passing adults and to all passing children. The children&apos;s home pattern has been tried, successfully, in a far more extreme form than we imagine here, in many kibbutzim where children are raised in collective nurseries, and merely visit their parents for a few hours per week. Treat the building as a collection of small connected buildings - BUILDING COMPLEX; lay an important neighborhood path right through the building, so that children who are not a part of the school can see and get to know it by meeting the children who are - BUILDING THOROUGHFARE(101) attach it to the local ADVENTURE PLAYGROUND ; make the teachers&apos; house an integral part of the interior -YOUR OWN HOME; and treat the common space itself as the hearth of a larger family - THE FAMILY, COMMON AREAS AT THE HEART.","sm_api_keyword_array":["children","home","need","adults","family"]}
