{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"7 THE COUNTRYSIDE","sm_api_content":"Define all farms as parks, where the public has a right to be; and make all regional parks into working farms. The stewards are given a lease for the land, and they are free to tend the land and set ground rules for its use - as a small farm, a forest, marshland, desert, and so forth. Every piece of countryside has keepers who have the right to farm it, if it is arable; or the obligation to look after it, if it is wild; and every piece of land is open to the people at large, provided they respect the organic processes which are going on there. The land ethic simply enlarges the boundaries of the community to include soils, waters, plants, and animals, or collectively: the land.... If we continue to treat the land as an instrument for our enjoyment, and as a source of economic profit, our parks and camps will become more artificial, more plastic, more like Disneyland. The land ethic replaces the idea of public parks and public campgrounds with the concept of a single countryside.","sm_api_keyword_array":["land","farm","forest","ethic","countryside"]}
