{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"224 LOW DOORWAY","sm_api_content":" Some of the doors in a building play a special role in creating transitions and maintaining privacy: it may be any of the doors governed by FAMILY OF ENTRANCES, or MAIN ENTRANCE, or THE FLOW THROUGH ROOMS or CORNER DOORS, or NATURAL DOORS AND WINDOWS. &quot;The 6&#039; 8&quot; rectangular door is such a standard pattern, and is so taken for granted, that it is hard to imagine how strongly it dominates the experience of transition. There have been times when people were more sensitive to the moment of passage, and made the shape of their doors convey the feeling of transition. Test the height before you build it, in place - NATURAL DOORS AND WINDOWS. Build the door frame as part of the structure - FRAMES AS THICKENED EDGES, and make it beautiful with ORNAMENT around the frame. If there is a door, glaze it, at least partially - SOLID DOORS WITH GLASS.","sm_api_keyword_array":["door","low","THROUGH","pattern","ENTRANCE"]}
