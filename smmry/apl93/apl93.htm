Concentrate food stands where cars and paths meet - either portable stands or small huts, or built into the fronts of buildings, half-open to the street. The food stands which make the best food, and which contribute most to city life, are the smallest shacks and carts from which individual vendors sell their wares. If we want food in our streets contributing to the social life of the streets, not helping to destroy it, the food stands must be made and placed accordingly. The best food always comes from family restaurants; and the best food in a foodstand always comes when people prepare the food and sell it themselves, according to their own ideas, their own recipes, their own choice. Treat these food stands as ACTIVITY POCKETS when they are part of a square; Use canvas roofs to make a simple shelter over them - CANVAS ROOF ; and keep them in line with the precepts of INDIVIDUALLY OWNED SHOPS: the best food always comes from people who are in business for themselves, who buy the raw food, and prepare it in their own style....","sm_api_keyword_array":["food","stands","street","own","place"]}
