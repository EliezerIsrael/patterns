{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"180 WINDOW PLACE","sm_api_content":"Everybody loves window seats, bay windows, and big windows with low sills and comfortable chairs drawn up to them. In every room where you spend any length of time during the day, make at least one window into a &quot;Window place&quot;. All of the following can function as &quot;Places&quot; in this sense: bay windows, window seats, a low window sill where there is an obvious position for a comfortable armchair, and deep alcoves with windows all around them. The most elaborate kind of window place: almost like a gazebo or a conservatory, windows all around it, a small room, almost part of the garden. In principle, any window with a reasonably pleasant view can be a window place, provided that it is taken seriously as a space, a volume, not merely treated as a hole in the wall. Window places should even be considered for waiting rooms or as special places along the length of hallways.","sm_api_keyword_array":["window","place","room","low","comfortable"]}
