{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"136 COUPLE&apos;S REALM","sm_api_content":" Make a special part of the house distinct from the common areas and all the children&#039;s rooms, where the man and woman of the house can be together in private. When children come, concern for parenthood often overwhelms the private sharing, and everything becomes exclusively oriented toward the children. Children are able to run everywhere in the house, and therefore tend to dominate all of it. The bathroom is often placed so that adults must walk past children&#039;s bedrooms to reach it. The result is that the private life of the couple is continually interrupted by the awareness that the children are nearby. In many respects it is a version of the pattern HOUSE FOR A COUPLE, embedded in the larger house with children.","sm_api_keyword_array":["children","place","couple","room","house"]}
