{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"120 PATHS AND GOALS","sm_api_content":" The layout of paths will seem right and comfortable only when it is compatible with the process of walking. The paths may be straight, or gently curving between goals; their paving should swell around the goal. As you walk along you scan the landscape for intermediate destinations - the furthest points along the path which you can see. 3- Since you do not want to keep changing direction while you walk and do not want to spend your whole time re-calculating your best direction of travel, you arrange your walking process in such a way that you pick a temporary &quot;Goal&quot; - some clearly visible landmark - which is more or less in the direction you want to take and then walk in a straight line toward it for a hundred yards as you get close, pick another new goal, once more a hundred yards further on, and walk toward it.... In the diagram above a person begins at A and heads for point E. Along the way, his intermediate goals are points B, C, and D. Since he is trying to walk in a roughly straight line toward E, his intermediate goal changes from B to C, as soon as C is visible; and from C to D, as soon as D is visible. If there aren&#039;t enough intermediate goals, the process of walking becomes more difficult, and consumes unnecessary emotional energy.","sm_api_keyword_array":["walk","goal","path","more","point"]}
