{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"178 COMPOST","sm_api_content":" To the average individual in the city, it probably appears that the sewage system works beautifully - no muss, no fuss. City dwellers who have had the experience of using a smelly outhouse would probably argue that our modern system of sewage disposal is a tremendous advance over earlier practices. The average new homeowner today, living on a 50 x 150 foot lot in the city, has paid $1500 as his share of the collection system which takes sewage from his house to the sewage treatment plant. We see then that the initial cost of today&#039;s sewage system is at least $2000 per house, often more. Even if industrial wastes were not allowed into the sewage system, an additional distribution system would be needed to get the sludge back to the land. We need a system that is less expensive; and we need a system that is an ecological benefit rather than an ecological drain.","sm_api_keyword_array":["system","sewage","use","water","cost"]}
