{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"33 NIGHT LIFE","sm_api_content":" Most of the city&#039;s activities close down at night; those which stay open won&#039;t do much for the night life of the city unless they are together. Knit together shops, amusements, and services which are open at night, along with hotels, bars, and all-night diners to form centers of night life: well-lit, safe, and lively places that increase the intensity of pedestrian activity at night by drawing all the people who are out at night to the same few spots in the town. People enjoy going out at night; a night on the town is something special. A paper by Shlomo Angel, &quot;The Ecology of Night Life&quot;, shows the highest number of street crimes occurring in those areas where night spots are scattered. Centralizing these places robs the city as a whole of several centers of night life. Treat the physical layout of the night life area exactly like any other ACTIVITY NODE, except that all of its establishments are open at night.","sm_api_keyword_array":["night","life","spots","place","Center"]}
