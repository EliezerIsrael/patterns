{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"141 A ROOM OF ONE&apos;S OWN","sm_api_content":" Give each member of the family a room of his own, especially adults. A minimum room of one&#039;s own is an alcove with desk, shelves, and curtain. In all cases, especially the adult ones, place these rooms at the far ends of the intimacy gradient - far from the common rooms. A person in a household without a room of his own will always be confronted with a problem: he wants to participate in family life and to be recognized as an important member of that group; but he cannot individualize himself because no part of the house is totally in his control. She belongs everywhere, and every place inside the house is in a vague sense hers yet it is only very rarely that the woman of the house has a small room which is specifically and exclusively her own. Even for small children, give them at least an alcove in the communal sleeping area - BED ALCOVE; and for the man and woman, give each of them a separate room, beyond the couples realm they share; it may be an expanded dressing room - DRESSING ROOM, a home workshop -HOME WORKSHOP, or once again, an alcove off some other room - ALCOVES, WORKSPACE ENCLOSURE- If there is money for it, it may even be possible to give a person a cottage, attached to the main structure - TEENAGER&#039;S COTTAGE, OLD AGE COTTAGE.","sm_api_keyword_array":["room","own","house","family","ones"]}
