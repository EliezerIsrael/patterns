{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"164 STREET WINDOWS","sm_api_content":" Wherever there are GREEN STREETS, SMALL PUBLIC SQUARES, PEDESTRIAN STREETS, BUILDING THOROUGHFARES - in short, any streets with people in them, these streets will only come to life if they are helped to do so by the people looking out on them, hanging out of windows, laughing, shouting, whistling. Where buildings run alongside busy streets, build windows with window seats, looking out onto the street. The street window provides a unique kind of connection between the life inside buildings and the street. The process of watching the street from upper story windows is strongly embedded in traditional Peruvian culture in the form of the mirador, the beautiful ornamented gallery which sticks out over the street from many of the colonial buildings in Lima. From the second and third floors people can shout down to the street, throw down a jacket or a ball; people in the street can whistle for a person to come to the window, and even glimpse the expressions on a person&#039;s face inside. One possible way of making a street window at ground level might be to build an alcove, two or three steps up, with a window on the street, its window-sill five feet above the street.","sm_api_keyword_array":["street","window","floor","people","build"]}
