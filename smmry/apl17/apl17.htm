{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"17 RING ROADS","sm_api_content":" At least one high speed road lies tangent to each local transport area.2. Each local transport area has at least one side not bounded by a high speed road&#039; but directly open to the countryside.

At the same time high speed roads do enormous damage when they are badly placed. To resolve these obvious dilemas? that come with the location and construction of high speed roads, we must find ways of building and locating these roads, so that they do not destroy communities and shatter life with their noise. Always place the high speed roads on boundaries between subcultures - SUBCULTURE BOUNDARY and never along waterfronts - ACCESS TO WATER.","sm_api_keyword_array":["road","high","speed","local","place"]}
