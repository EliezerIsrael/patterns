{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"183 WORKSPACE ENCLOSURE","sm_api_content":" People cannot work effectively if their workspace is too enclosed or too exposed. If there are other people working nearby, arrange the enclosure so that the person has a sense of connection to two or three others; but never put more than eight workspaces within view or earshot of one another. In the interview, we first asked each person to think of the very best workspace he had ever worked in and the very worst; and then asked him to make a sketch plan of both spaces. You feel more comfortable in a workspace if there is a wall behind you. Each workspace should be 50 to 75 per cent enclosed by walls or windows. For the view, give each workspace a window to the outside - WINDOWS OVERLOOKING LIFE; surround the space with thick walls which contain shelves and storage space - HALF-OPEN WALL, THICK WALLS, OPEN SHELVES, WAIST-HIGH SHELF; arrange a pool of incandescent light over the work table to set it off - POOLS OF LIGHT; and try to make a sitting place, next to the workspace, so that the pulse of work, and talk can happen easily throughout the day - SITTING CIRCLE.","sm_api_keyword_array":["workspace","work","wall","person","each"]}
