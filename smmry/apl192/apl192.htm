Thomas Markus presents evidence which shows clearly that office workers prefer windows with meaningful views - views of city life, nature - as against views which also take in large areas, but contain uninteresting and less meaningful elements. We now give very rough figures for the total area of the windows in a room. In each case, measure the window area as a percentage of the floor area; then take the average of the different percentages. In our part of the world - Berkeley, California - we find that rooms are most pleasant when they have about 25 per cent window - sometimes as much as 50 per cent -. Fine tune the exact positions of the windows at the time that you build them - NATURAL DOORS AND WINDOWS; break the area of each window into SMALL PANES; give each window a very LOW SILL to improve the view and DEEP REVEALS to make the light as soft as possible inside....","sm_api_keyword_array":["window","room","view","area","LIGHT"]}
