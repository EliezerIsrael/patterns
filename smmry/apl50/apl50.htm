{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"50 T JUNCTIONS","sm_api_content":" If major roads are in position - PARALLEL ROADS, and you are in the process of defining the local roads, this pattern gives the nature of the intersections. Traffic accidents are far more frequent where two roads cross than at T junctions. Lay out the road system so that any two roads which meet at grade, meet in three-way T junctions as near 90 degrees as possible. Where two two-way roads cross, there are 16 major collision points, compared with three for a T junction. Further evidence shows that the T junction is safest if it is a right-angled junction. At busy junctions, where pedestrian paths converge, make a special raised crossing for pedestrians, something more than the usual crosswalk - ROAD CROSSING....","sm_api_keyword_array":["road","junction","accidents","cross","two"]}
