{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"219 FLOOR-CEILING VAULTS","sm_api_content":" We seek a ceiling vault shape which will support a live load on the floor above, form the ceiling of the room below, and generate as little bending and tension as possible so that compressive materials can be relied on. Use a type of construction which makes it possible to fit the vault to any shaped room after the walls and columns are in position: on no account use a prefabricated vault. The vault shape is governed by two constraints: the ceiling cannot be lower than about 6 feet at the edge of the room, except in occasional attic rooms; and the ceiling in the middle of the room should vary with the room size (8 to 12 feet for large rooms, 7 to 9 feet for middle sized rooms, and 6 to 7 feet for the very smallest alcoves and corners - see CEILING HEIGHT VARIETY. All of these are well within the capacity of the vault, and besides, shrinkage reinforcement in the vault will make it even stronger. The analysis shows that even though the vault is an impure form, its structural behavior is still close enough to that of a pure vault to work essentially as a compression structure. When the main vault is finished, mark the positions of all those columns which will be placed on the floor above it - FINAL COLUMN DISTRIBUTION - Whenever there are columns which are more than 2 feet away from the perimeter beam, strengthen the vault with ribs and extra reinforcing to withstand the vertical forces.","sm_api_keyword_array":["vault","room","use","FLOOR","CEILING"]}
