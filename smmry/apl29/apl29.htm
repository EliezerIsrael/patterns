In order to be precise about the gradient of housing densities, let us agree at once, to analyze the densities by means of three concentric semi-circular rings, of equal radial thickness, around the main center of activity. We now define a density gradient, as a set of three densities, one for each of the three rings. Within the rings of density, encourage housing to take the form of housing clusters - self-governing cooperatives of 8 to 15 households, their physical size varying according to the density - HOUSE CLUSTER. According to the densities in the different rings, build these houses as free-standing houses -HOUSE CLUSTER, ROW HOUSES, or higher density clusters of housing - HOUSING HILL. Keep public spaces - PROMENADE, SMALL PUBLIC SQUARES to those areas which have a high enough density around them to keep them alive PEDESTRIAN DENSITY ....","sm_api_keyword_array":["density","ring","people","different","three"]}
