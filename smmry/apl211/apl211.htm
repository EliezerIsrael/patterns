{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"211 THICKENING THE OUTER WALLS","sm_api_content":" We have established in THICK WALLS, how important it is for the walls of a building to have &quot;Depth&quot; and &quot;Volume,&quot; so that character accumulates, in them, with time. The walls will not usually be thick in the literal sense, except in certain special cases where mud construction, for example, lends itself to the making of walls. If the framework of a wall is made of columns standing away from the back face of the wall, then the wall invites modification - it becomes natural and easy to nail planks to the columns, and so make seats, and shelves, and changes there. Theoretically, a person can always add things which stick out from the wall, the very smoothness of the wall makes it much less likely to happen. In order to make an alcove or thick wall work as a buttress, build its roof as near as possible to a continuation of the curve of the floor vault immediately inside. When you lay out columns and minor colunms, put a column at the corner of every thick wall, so that the wall space, like other social spaces, becomes a recognizable part of the building structure - COLUMNS AT THE CORNERS.","sm_api_keyword_array":["wall","Thick","build","column","vault"]}
