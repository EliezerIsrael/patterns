{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"42 INDUSTRIAL RIBBON","sm_api_content":" Place industry in ribbons, between 200 and 500 feet wide, which form the boundaries between communities. Break these ribbons into long blocks, varying in area between 1 and 25 acres; and treat the edge of every ribbon as a place where people from nearby communities can benefit from the offshoots of the industrial activity. Ribbons whose width varies between 200 and 500 feet, with sites varying in length between 200 and 2000 feet, will be able to provide the necessary range of one to 25-acre sites in compact blocks, and are still narrow enough to keep communities on opposite sides of the ribbon reasonably connected. Place the ribbons near enough to RING ROADS so that trucks can pass directly from the ribbons to the ring road, without having to pass through any other intermediate areas. Develop the internal layout of the industrial ribbon like any other work community, though slightly more spread out WORK COMMUNITY. Place the important buildings of each industry, the &quot;Heart&quot; of the plant, toward the edge of the ribbon to form usable streets and outdoor spaces - POSITIVE OUTDOOR SPACE, BUlLDING FRONTS.","sm_api_keyword_array":["ribbon","industry","Place","industrial","truck"]}
