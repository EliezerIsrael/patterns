{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"150 A PLACE TO WAIT","sm_api_content":" In any office, or workshop, or public service, or station, or clinic, where people have to wait - INTERCHANGE, HEALTH CENTER, SMALL SERVICES WITHOUT RED TAPE, OFFICE CONNECTIONS, it is essential to provide a special place for waiting, and doubly essential that this place not have the sordid, enclosed, time-slowed character of ordinary waiting rooms. In places where people end up waiting, create a situation which makes the waiting positive. Fuse the waiting with some other activity - newspaper, coffee, pool tables, horseshoes; something which draws people in who are not simply waiting. On the one hand, whatever people are waiting for - the doctor, an airplane, a business appointment - has built in uncertainties, which make it inevitable that they must spend a long time hanging around, waiting, doing nothing. How can the people who are waiting, spend their time wholeheartedly - live the hours or minutes while they wait, as fully as the other hours of their day - and yet still be on hand, whenever the event or the person they are waiting for is ready?. The right atmosphere will come naturally if the waiting area provides some places that are quiet, protected, and do not draw out the anxiety of the wait.","sm_api_keyword_array":["wait","people","place","room","seat"]}
