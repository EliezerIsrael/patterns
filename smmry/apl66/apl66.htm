{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"66 HOLY GROUND","sm_api_content":" In each community and neighborhood, identify some sacred site as consecrated ground, and form a series of nested precincts, each marked by a gateway, each one progressively more private, and more sacred than the last, the innermost a final sanctum that can only be reached by passing through all of the outer ones. In all traditional societies, where these rites are treated with enormous power and respect, the rites, in one form or another, are supported by parts of the physical environment which have the character of gates. A hospital is no place for a baptism; a funeral home makes it impossible to feel the meaning of a funeral. There are many examples: the Inner Cit of Peking; the fact that anyone who has audience with the Pope must wait in each of seven waiting rooms; the Aztec sacrifices took place on stepped pyramids, each step closer to the sacrifice; the Ise shrine, the most famous shrine in Japan, is a nest of precincts, each one inside the ither. When such a place exists in a community, even if it is not associated with any particular religion, we believe that the feeling of holiness, in some form or other, will gradually come to life there among the people who share in the experience. At each threshold between precincts build a gate - MAIN GATEWAYS - at each gate, a place to pause with a new view toward the next most inner place - ZEN VIEW and at the innermost sanctum, something very quiet and able to inspire - perhaps a view, or no more than a simple tree, or pool - POOLS AND STREAMS, TREE PLACES ....","sm_api_keyword_array":["place","each","rite","through","gate"]}
