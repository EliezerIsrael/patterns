{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"191 THE SHAPE OF INDOOR SPACE","sm_api_content":" With occasional exceptions, make each indoor space or each position of a space, a rough rectangle, with roughly straight walls, near right angles in the corners, and a roughly symmetrical vault over each room. Since a social space is convex - see the extensive argument in POSITIVE OUTDOOR SPACE - it must either have a wall which is concave or a wall which is perfectly straight. Every wall with social spaces on both sides of it, must have straight walls, except where it is thick enough to be concave on both sides. Polygon, rough rectangle, thick curved wall, exterior curved wall. Avoid curved walls except where they are strictly necessary - WALL MEMBRANES. Make the walls of each room generous and deep -THICK WALLS, CLOSETS BETWEEN ROOMS; and where it is appropriate, make them HALF-OPEN WALLS.","sm_api_keyword_array":["wall","space","angle","room","where"]}
