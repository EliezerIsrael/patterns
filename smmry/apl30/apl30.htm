{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"30 ACTIVITY NODES","sm_api_content":" To understand its action, imagine that a community and its boundary are growing under the influence of COMMUNITY OF 7000, SUBCULTURE BOUNDARY, IDENTIFIABLE NEIGHBORHOOD, NEIGHBORHOOD BOUNDARY, ECCENTRIC NUCLEUS, and DENSITY RINGS. Then modify the layout of the paths in the community to bring as many of them through these spots as possible. One of the greatest problems in existing communities is the fact that the available public life in them is spread so thin that it has no impact on the community. To create these concentrations of people in a community, facilities must be grouped densely round very small public squares which can function as nodes - with all pedestrian movement in the community organized to pass through these nodes. First, each node must draw together the main paths in the surrounding community. In any case the relationship between paths, community facilities, and squares is vital and hard to achieve.","sm_api_keyword_array":["community","path","square","small","Node"]}
