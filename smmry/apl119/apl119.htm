{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"119 ARCADES","sm_api_content":" Paths along the building, short paths between buildings, PEDESTRIAN STREET, paths between CONNECTED BUILDINGS, and parts of CIRCULATION REALMS are all best as arcades. Arcades - covered walkways at the edge of buildings, which are partly inside, partly outside - play a vital role in the way that people interact with buildings. Wherever paths run along the edge of buildings, build arcades, and use the arcades, above all, to connect up the buildings to one another, so that a person can walk from place to place under the cover of the arcades. If the major paths through and beside the buildings are genuinely public, covered by an extension of the building, a low arcade, with openings into the building - many doors and windows and half-open walls - then people are drawn into the building; the action is on display, they feel tangentially a part of it. Arcades run along the building, where it meets the public world; they are open to the public, yet set partly into the building and at least seven feet deep. The importance of these arcades which pass right through a building depends on the same functional effects as those described in BUILDING THOROUGHFARE.","sm_api_keyword_array":["build","arcade","public","world","place"]}
