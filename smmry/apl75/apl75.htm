{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"75 THE FAMILY","sm_api_content":" Private realms for the groups and individuals that make up the extended family: couple&#039;s realms, private rooms, sub-households for small families. Until a few years ago, human society was based on the extended family: a family of at least three generations, with parents, children, grandparents, uncles, aunts, and cousins, all living together in a single or loosely knit multiple household. Each person in a nuclear family is too tightly linked to other members of the family; any one relationship which goes sour, even for a few hours, becomes critical; people cannot simply turn away toward uncles, aunts, grandchildren, cousins, brothers. Since the old extended family, based on blood ties, seems to be gone - at least for the moment - this can only happen if small families, couples, and single people join together in voluntary &quot;Families&quot; of ten or so. &quot;An entirely different kind of family. Not exclusive, like your families, and not predestined, not compulsory. An inclusive, unpredestined and voluntary family. Twenty pairs of fathers and mothers, eight or nine ex-fathers and ex-mothers, and forty or fifty assorted children of all ages.&quot; Physically, the setting for a large voluntary family must provide for a balance of privacy and communality. Each individual household within the larger family must, at all costs, have a clearly defined territory of its own, which it controls - YOUR OWN HOME; treat the individual territories according to the nature of the individual households - HOUSE FOR A SMALL FAMILY, HOUSE FOR A COUPLE, HOUSE FOR ONE PERSON; and build common space between them, where the members of the different smaller households can meet and eat together - COMMON AREAS AT THE HEART, COMMUNAL EATING.","sm_api_keyword_array":["family","household","house","Each","people"]}
