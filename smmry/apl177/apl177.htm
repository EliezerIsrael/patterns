{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"177 VEGETABLE GARDEN","sm_api_content":" In a healthy town every family can grow vegetables for itself. Set aside one piece of land either in the private garden or on common land as a vegetable garden. Make sure the vegetable garden is in a sunny place and central to all the households it serves. If we compare dairy products, vegetables and fruits, meats, and synthetic foods, the vegetables play the most essential role. Since the industrial revolution, there has been a growing tendency for people to rely on impersonal producers for their vegetables; however, in a world where vegetables are central and where self-sufficiency increases, it becomes as natural for families to have their own vegetables as their own air. The amount of land it takes to grow the vegetables for a household is surprisingly small.","sm_api_keyword_array":["vegetable","garden","land","grow","private"]}
