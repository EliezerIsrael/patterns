{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"146 FLEXIBLE OFFICE SPACE","sm_api_content":" Lay out the office space as wings of open space, with free standing columns around their edges, so they define half-private and common spaces opening into one another. In either case, create a variety of space throughout the office - comparable in variety to the different sizes and kinds of space in a large old house. The standard approaches to the problem of flexibility in office spaces are: uninterrupted modular space with modular partitions and entire floors of uninterrupted space with low ceilings and no partitions. Though these spaces were designed to support family life, they turn out also to support the natural structure of work groups: there are small spaces for private and half-private offices, slightly larger spaces for work groups of two to six, usually one space where up to 12 people can gather, and a commons centered around the kitchen and dining room. Far more often, the work groups which will occupy the space are unknown at the time the space is built. The kind of space which will create this possibility is not &quot;Warehouse&quot; space or &quot;Office landscape&quot; space but instead, a kind of space which contains the possibility that people need, in the form of columns and ceiling height variety, to encourage them to modify it as they use it.","sm_api_keyword_array":["space","work","office","partition","group"]}
