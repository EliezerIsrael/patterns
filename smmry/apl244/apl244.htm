{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"244 CANVAS ROOFS","sm_api_content":" Around every building there are ROOF GARDENS, ARCADES, PRIVATE TERRACES ON THE STREET, OUTDOOR ROOMS, GALLERY SURROUNDS, TRELLISED WALKS, and WINDOW PLACES, even SMALL PARKING LOTS, which all become more subtle and more beautiful with canvas roofs and awnings. There is a very special beauty about tents and canvas awnings. Build canvas roofs and walls and awnings wherever there are spaces which need softer light or partial shade in summer, or partial protection from mist and dew in autumn and winter. The canvas overhead being translucent, there is a very beautiful light to live and work in; I have experienced nothing like it elsewhere except in Japan somewhat, in their houses with sliding paper walls or &quot;Shoji&quot;. The windows which look into patios give light to rooms and may be curtained for visual control - but since the cold and damp are kept out by the patio canvas there need be no glass in the windows and no expensive moving parts. Use the canvas awnings, especially, to filter light over those windows which face west and south and glare because they face the sky - FILTERED LIGHT.","sm_api_keyword_array":["canvas","awning","Build","WINDOW","LIGHT"]}
