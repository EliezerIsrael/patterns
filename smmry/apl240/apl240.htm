{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"240 HALF-INCH TRIM","sm_api_content":" Totalitarian, machine buildings do not require trim because they are precise enough to do without. Choose the pieces of trim so that the smallest piece, in each component, is always of the order of 1/2 inch wide. If, as we suggest, the building procedure is looser and allows much larger tolerance - even mistakes on the order of half an inch or more - then the use of trim to cover the connection between materials becomes essential. Buildings built in the last 25 years often make a virtue out of boldness, and there is a tendency to use very large oversized pieces of trim instead of small pieces. There is a psychological reason for making sure that every component in the building has at least some pieces of trim which are of the order of half an inch or an inch thick, and no more. In many cases, you may be able to use the trim to form the ornaments - ORNAMENT; and trims may occasionally be colored: even tiny amounts can help to make the light in a room warm - WARM COLORS.","sm_api_keyword_array":["trim","building","piece","inch","material"]}
