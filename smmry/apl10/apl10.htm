{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"10 MAGIC OF THE CITY","sm_api_content":" These centers can help to form the mosaic of subcultures by their variety; and they can also help to form CITY COUNTRY FINGERS, if each of the centers is at a natural meeting point of several fingers. Land near the core is expensive; few people can live near enough to it to give them genuine access to the city&#039;s life; most people live far out from the core. If we are to resolve the problem by decentralizing centers, we must ask what the minimum population is that can support a central business district with the magic of the city. Otis D. Duncan &quot;The Optimum Size of Cities&quot;, shows that cities with more than 50,000 people have a big enough market to sustain 61 different kinds of retail shops and that cities with over 100,000 people can support sophisticated jewelry, fur, and fashion stores. In a study of regional shopping centers in metropolitan Chicago, Brian K. Berry found that centers with 70 kinds of retail shops serve a population base of about 350,000 people. Since, for the reasons given earlier, it is desirable to have as many centers as possible, we propose that the city region should have one center for each 300,000 people, with the centers spaced out widely among the population, so that every person in the region is reasonably close to at least one of these major centers.","sm_api_keyword_array":["city","center","people","each","300,000"]}
