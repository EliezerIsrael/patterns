{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"78 HOUSE FOR ONE PERSON","sm_api_content":" Either build them to fit into some larger group household, or even attach them, as ancillary cottages to other, ordinary family households like HOUSE FOR A SMALL FAMILY or HOUSE FOR A COUPLE. Conceive a house for one person as a place of the utmost simplicity: essentially a one-room cottage or studio, with large and small alcoves around it. The housing market contains few houses or apartments specifically built for one person. The plan of such a house will be characteristically different from other houses, primarily because it requires almost no differentiation of its spaces: it need only be one room. The nooks replace the rooms in a larger house; they are for bed, bath, kitchen, workshop and entrance. Again, make the house an individual piece of territory, with its own garden, no matter how small -YOUR OWN HOME; make the main room essentially a kind of farmhouse kitchen -FARMHOUSE KITCHEN, with alcoves opening off it for sitting, working, bathing, sleeping, dressing - BATHING ROOM, WINDOW PLACE, WORKSPACE ENCLOSURE, BED ALCOVE, DRESSING ROOM; if the house is meant for an old person, or for someone very young, shape it also according to the pattern for OLD AGE COTTAGE or TEENAGER&#039;S COTTAGE....","sm_api_keyword_array":["HOUSE","person","place","SMALL","larger"]}
