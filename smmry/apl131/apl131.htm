{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"131 THE FLOW THROUGH ROOMS","sm_api_content":" The movement between rooms is as important as the rooms themselves; and its arrangement has as much effect on social interaction in the rooms, as the interiors of the rooms. In a building where the movement is mean, the passages are dark and narrow - rooms open off them as dead ends; you spend your time entering the building, or moving between rooms, like a crab scuttling in the dark. When such a loop passes through rooms, it connects rooms far more than a simple passage does. A building where there is a chain of rooms in sequence also works like this, if there is a passage in parallel with the chain of rooms. Always make sure that these rooms for movement have plenty of light in them and perhaps a view - ZEN VIEW, TAPESTRY OF LIGHT AND DARK, and LIGHT ON TWO SIDES OF EVERY ROOM. Keep doors which open into rooms, or doors between rooms which create the flow through rooms, in the corners of the rooms - CORNER DOORS(196)....","sm_api_keyword_array":["room","movement","building","passage","between"]}
