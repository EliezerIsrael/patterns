Between the natural paths which cross a public square or courtyard or a piece of common land choose something to stand roughly in the middle: a fountain, a tree, a statue, a clock-tower with seats, a windmill, a bandstand. We have discussed the fact that people tend to take up positions from which they are protected, partly, at their backs - HIERARCHY OF OPEN SPACE, and the way this fact tends to make the action grow around the edge of public squares - ACTIVITY POCKETS, STAIR SEATS. The same thing happens in a courtyard or a public square. Even in the Piazza San Marco, one of the few squares without an obvious center piece, the campanile juts out and creates an off beat center to the two plazas together. Imagine the open square of a small market town in the country, covered with deep snow and criss-crossed by several roads and paths that, shaped by the traffic, form the natural lines of communication.","sm_api_keyword_array":["square","center","middle","PATH","PUBLIC"]}
