{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"127 INTIMACY GRADIENT","sm_api_content":" In any building - house, office, public building, summer cottage - people need a gradient of settings, which have different degrees of intimacy. As far as we can tell, a Peruvian house must not, under any circumstances, violate the principle of the intimacy gradient. The intimacy gradient is unusually crucial in a Peruvian house. In a house: gate, outdoor porch, entrance, sitting wall, common space and kitchen, private garden, bed alcoves. In a more formal house, the sequence might begin with something like the Peruvian sala- a parlor or sitting room for guests. In private houses make the ENTRANCE ROOM the most formal and public place and arrange the most private areas so that each person has a room of his own, where he can retire to be alone - A ROOM OF ONE&#039;S OWN.","sm_api_keyword_array":["house","building","room","area","space"]}
