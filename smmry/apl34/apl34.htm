{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"34 INTERCHANGE","sm_api_content":" Some of the area around interchanges should be given over to houses for those people who rely entirely on public transportation - especially old people. To meet their needs, the area around interchanges must be zoned so that the kind of housing that suits them will develop there - OLD PEOPLE EVERYWHERE. The interchange must be convenient for people walking from their homes and jobs, and it must be safe. People will not use an interchange if it is dingy, derelict, and deserted. There must be enough shops and kiosks in the interchange, to keep a steady flow of people moving in and out of it and through it. Place HOUSING HILLS, OLD PEOPLE EVERYWHERE, and WORK COMMUNITIES round the interchange; treat the outside of the interchange as an ACTIVITY NODE to assure its continuity with the pedestrian network; treat the transfers as ARCADES where necessary to keep them under cover; give every interchange a BUS STOP on the MINI-BUS network....","sm_api_keyword_array":["interchange","people","TRANSPORTATION","PUBLIC","system"]}
