{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"226 COLUMN PLACE","sm_api_content":" Certain columns, especially those which are free standing, play an important social role, beyond their structural role as COLUMNS AT THE CORNERS. Thin columns, spindly columns, columns which take their shape from structural arguments alone, will never make a comfortable environment. When a column is free standing, make it as thick as a man - at least 12 inches, preferably 16 inches: and form places around it where people can sit and lean comfortably: a step, a small seat built up against the column, or a space formed by a pair of columns. Four inch steel pipes or 6 inch reinforced concrete columns break up space, but they destroy it as a place for human action, because they do not create &quot;Spots&quot; where people can be comfortable. In short, if the column has to be there, it will destroy a considerable area unless it is made to be a place where people feel comfortable to stay, a natural focus, a place to sit down, a place to lean. You can get the extra thickness quite cheaply if you build the column as a BOX COLUMN; complete the &quot;Place&quot; the column forms, by giving it a &quot;Roof&quot; in the form of a column capital, or vault which springs from the column, or by bracing the column against the beams - COLUMN CONNECTION.","sm_api_keyword_array":["column","place","space","people","make"]}
