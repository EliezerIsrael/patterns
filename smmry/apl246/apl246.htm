{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"246 CLIMBING PLANTS","sm_api_content":" Two earlier patterns can be helped by climbing plants around the building: TRELLISED WALK and FILTERED LIGHT. A building finally becomes a part of its surroundings when the plants grow over parts of it as freely as they grow along the ground. On sunny walls, train climbing plants to grow up round the openings in the wall-the windows, doors, porches, arcades, and trellises. One argument, consistent with others in the book, is that climbing plants effect a smooth transition between the built and the natural. When the plants grow around the openings of buildings, they create a special kind of filtered light inside. Perhaps most important, the texture of climbing plants is ever different; it is subtly different from day to day, as the wind and sun play upon it; and it is greatly different from season to season.","sm_api_keyword_array":["plant","grow","building","climb","around"]}
