Where paths need special protection or where they need some intimacy, build a trellis over the path and plant it with climbing flowers. In PATH SHAPE, we have described the need for outdoor paths to have a shape, like rooms. Use it to emphasize the path it covers, and to set off one part of the path as a special section of a longer path in order to make it an especially nice and inviting place to walk. Since the trellised path creates enclosure around the spaces which it bounds, use it to create a virtual wall to define an outdoor space. Pave the path with loosely set stones - PAVING WITH CRACKS BETWEEN THE STONES - Use climbing plants and a fine trellis work to create the special quality of soft, filtered light underneath the trellis - FILTERED LIGHT, CLIMBING PLANTS ....","sm_api_keyword_array":["path","OUTDOOR","space","need","place"]}
