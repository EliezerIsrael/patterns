{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"171 TREE PLACES","sm_api_content":" If you have followed SITE REPAIR, you have already taken care to leave the trees intact and undisturbed by new construction; you may have planted FRUIT TREES; and you may perhaps also have other additional trees in mind. If you are planting trees, plant them according to their nature, to form enclosures, avenues, squares, groves, and single spreading trees toward the middle of open spaces. Shape the nearby buildings in response to trees, so that the trees themselves, and the trees and buildings together, form places which people can use. For the most part, the trees that are being planted and transplanted in cities and suburbs today do not satisfy people&#039;s craving for trees. Trees have the potential to create various kinds of social places: an umbrella - where a single, low-sprawling tree like an oak defines an outdoor room; a pair - where two trees form a gateway; a grove - where several trees cluster together; a square - where they enclose an open space; and an avenue - where a double row of trees, their crowns touching, line a path or street. Make the trees form &quot;Rooms&quot; and spaces, avenues, and squares, and groves, by placing trellises between the trees, and walks, and seats under the trees themselves - OUTDOOR ROOM, TRELLISED WALK, GARDEN SEAT, SEAT SPOTS.","sm_api_keyword_array":["tree","people","place","form","plant"]}
