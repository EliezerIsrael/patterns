{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"172 GARDEN GROWING WILD","sm_api_content":" In short, we must decide what kind of garden to have, what kind of plants to grow, what style of gardening is compatible with both artifice and nature. These gardens have none of the quality which brings a garden to life - the quality of a wilderness, tamed, still wild, but cultivated enough to be in harmony with the buildings which surround it and the people who move in it. In these gardens things are arranged so that the natural processes which come into being will maintain the condition of the garden and not degrade it. In a sensible and natural garden, the garden is arranged so that this process enhances the garden and does not threaten it. In the garden growing wild the plants are chosen, and the boundaries placed, in such a way that the growth of things regulates itself. A garden growing wild is healthier, more capable of stable growth, than the more clipped and artificial garden.","sm_api_keyword_array":["garden","grow","plants","flower","natural"]}
