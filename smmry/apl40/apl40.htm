{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"40 OLD PEOPLE EVERYWHERE","sm_api_content":" Old people need old people, but they also need the young, and young people need contact with the old. The young in other parts of town, have no chance of the benefit of older company, and the old people themselves are far too isolated. The fact is that contemporary society shunts away old people; and the more shunted away they are, the deeper the rift between the old and young. The segregation of the old causes the same rift inside each individual life: as old people pass into old age communities their ties with their own past become unacknowledged, lost, and there fore broken. At the same time, they obviously need other old people around them; and some old people who are infirm need special services. Treat the core like any group house; make all the cottages, both those close to and those further away, small - OLD AGE COTTAGE, some of them perhaps connected to the larger family houses in the neighborhood - THE FAMILY; provide every second or third core with proper nursing facilities; somewhere in the orbit of the old age pocket, provide the kind of work which old people can manage best - especially teaching and looking after tiny children - NETWORK OF LEARNING, CHILDREN&#039;S HOME, SETTLED WORK, VEGETABLE GARDEN ....","sm_api_keyword_array":["old","people","NEIGHBORHOOD","need","age"]}
