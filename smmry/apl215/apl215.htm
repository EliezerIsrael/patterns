Build a ground floor slab, raised slightly - six or nine inches above the ground - by first building a low perimeter wall around the building, tied into the column foundations, and then filling it with rubble, gravel, and concrete. A raised ground floor slab built inside a brick perimeter wall. When the ground is relatively level, a concrete slab which sits directly on the ground is the most natural and cheapest way of building a ground floor. Build the low wall which forms the edge of the ground floor slab out of brick, and tie it directly into all the terraces and paths around the building - CONNECTION TO THE EARTH, SOFT TILE AND BRICK. If you are building on a steep sloped site, build part of the ground floor as a vaulted floor instead of excavating to form a slab - FLOOR-CEILING VAULTS....","sm_api_keyword_array":["floor","ground","slab","Build","wall"]}
