{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"139 FARMHOUSE KITCHEN","sm_api_content":" The isolated kitchen, separate from the family and considered as an efficient but unpleasant factory for food is a hangover from the days of servants; and from the more recent days when women willingly took over the servants&#039; role. Make the kitchen bigger than usual, big enough to include the &quot;Family room&quot; space, and place it near the center of the commons, not so far back in the house as an ordinary kitchen. In traditional societies, where there were no servants and the members of a family took care of their own food, the isolated kitchen was virtually unknown. When the servants disappeared, the kitchen was still left separate, because it was thought &quot;Genteel&quot; and &quot;Nice&quot; to eat in dining rooms away from any sight or smell of food. In the farmhouse kitchen, kitchen work and family activity were completely integrated in one big room. When you place the kitchen counters later, make them really long and generous and toward the south to get the light - COOKING LAYOUT, SUNNY COUNTER; leave room for an alcove or two around the kitchen - ALCOVES; make the table in the middle big, and hang a nice big warm single light right in the middle to draw the family around it - EATING ATMOSPHERE; surround the walls, when you detail them, with plenty of open shelves for pots, and mugs, and bottles, and jars of jam - OPEN SHELVES, WAIST-HIGH SHELF.","sm_api_keyword_array":["kitchen","family","room","big","cooking"]}
