In more detail: people gravitate naturally toward the edge of public spaces. If the edge does not provide them with places where it is natural to linger, the space becomes a place to walk through, not a place to stop. The scalloped edge must surround the space entirely. To make the space lively, the scalloped edge must surround the space completely.","sm_api_keyword_array":["edge","space","activity","pockets","PATH"]}
