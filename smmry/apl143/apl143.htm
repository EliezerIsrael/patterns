{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"143 BED CLUSTER","sm_api_content":" Place the children&#039;s beds in alcoves or small alcove-like rooms, around a common playspace. In between these two extremes, there is a kind of configuration in which children have their own, small, private spaces, not as large as rooms, clustered around a common playspace. In short, for young children, especially in that age when feelings of possession and control are developing, the one room with many beds is just too difficult. In spite of this potentially reasonable cultural relativism, it seems to us that although adults do need their own rooms, the isolation of a private room for a small child may perhaps be fundamentally incompatible with healthy psycho-social development; and might even do organic damage. Children need some privacy, some way of retreating from endless squabbles about territory, some way of having a miniature version of the adult&#039;s &quot;Room of his own.&quot; Yet at the same time, they also need extensive, almost animal, contact with others - their talk, their care, their touch, their sound, their smell. Use the location of dressing areas and closets to help shape the bed cluster and the individual alcoves - DRESSING ROOM, CLOSETS BETWEEN ROOMS ; include some tiny nooks and crannies - CHILD CAVESGive the entire space LIGHT ON TWO SIDES.","sm_api_keyword_array":["children","room","bed","sleep","need"]}
