{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"45 NECKLACE OF COMMUNITY PROJECTS","sm_api_content":" LOCAL TOWN HALL calls for small centers of local government at the heart of every community. The local town hall will not be an honest part of the community which lives around it, unIess it is itself surrounded by all kinds of small community activities and projects, generated by the people for themselves. Allow the growth of shop-size spaces around the local town hall, and any other appropriate community building. Front these shops on a busy path, and lease them for a minimum rent to ad hoc community groups for political work, trial services, research, and advocate groups. A lively process of community self-government depends on an endless series of ad hoc political and service groups, functioning freely, each with a proper chance to test its ideas before the townspeople. Finally, to bring these groups into natural contact with the community, the fabric of storefronts should be built to include sonme of the stable shops and services that the community needs- barbershop, cafe, laundromat.","sm_api_keyword_array":["community","TOWN","space","group","small"]}
