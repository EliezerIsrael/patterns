{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"106 POSITIVE OUTDOOR SPACE","sm_api_content":" There are two fundamentally different kinds of outdoor space: negative space and positive space. If you look at the plan of an environment where outdoor spaces are negative, you see the buildings as figure, and the outdoor space as ground. If you look at the plan of an environment where outdoor spaces are positive, you may see the buildings as figure, and outdoor spaces as ground - and,you may also see the outdoor spaces as figure against the ground of the buildings. In mathematics, a space is convex when a line joining any two points inside the space itself lies totally inside the space. People feel comfortable in spaces which are &quot;Positive&quot; and use these spaces; people feel relatively uncomfortable in spaces which are &quot;Negative&quot; and such spaces tend to remain unused. Use open trellised walks, walls, and trees to close off spaces which are too exposed - TREE PLACES, CARDEN WALL, TRELLISED WALK; but make sure that every space is always open to some larger space, so that it is not too enclosed - HIERARCHY OF OPEN SPACE.","sm_api_keyword_array":["space","Outdoor","build","positive","open"]}
