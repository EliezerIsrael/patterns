{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"20 MINI-BUSES","sm_api_content":" Establish a system of small taxi-like buses, carrying up to six people each, radio-controlled, on call by telephone, able to provide point-to-point service according to the passengers&#039; needs, and supplemented by a computer system which guarantees minimum detours, and minimum waiting times. While conventional fixed route public transport systems are experiencing a dangerous spiral of lower levels of service, fewer passengers, and increased public subsidies, over 30 working dial-a-bus systems are presently in successful operation throughout the world. A dial-a-bus system in Regina, Saskatchewan, is the only part of the Regina Transit System which supports itself. Among the physically disabled about 5.7 million are potential riders of public transportation if the system could take them door-to-door. Second, quite apart from these special needs, the fact is that a web of public transportation, with large buses, boats, and trains, will not work anyway, without a mini-bus system. The mini-bus system is essential for the purpose of providing feeder service in the larger web of public transportation.","sm_api_keyword_array":["system","PUBLIC","TRANSPORTATION","bus","people"]}
