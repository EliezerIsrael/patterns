{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"163 OUTDOOR ROOM","sm_api_content":" There is another way of being outdoors: and its needs are not met by the garden at all. Build a place outdoors which has so much enclosure round it, that it takes on the feeling of a room, even though it is open to the sky. They need an outdoor room, a literal outdoor room - a partly enclosed space, outdoors, but enough like a room so that people behave there as they do in rooms, but with the added beauties of the sun, and wind, and smells, and rustling leaves, and crickets. Even the &quot;Picture window,&quot; as the domestic version of the show-window is called, has contributed to the estrangement between indoors and outdoors; the garden has become a spectator garden. An outdoor space becomes a special outdoor room when it is well enclosed with walls of the building, walls of foliage, columns, trellis, and sky; and when the outdoor room, together with an indoor space, forms a virtually continuous living area. An OUTDOOR ROOM has walls around it and is only partially roofed; while a PUBLIC OUTDOOR ROOM has a roof, but essentially no walls.","sm_api_keyword_array":["outdoor","garden","room","wall","place"]}
