{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"157 HOME WORKSHOP","sm_api_content":" As the decentralization of work becomes more and more effective, the workshop in the home grows and grows in importance. We have explained in SCATTERED WORK, NETWORK OF LEARNING, MEN AND WOMEN, SELF-GOVERNING WORKSHOPS AND OFFICES, and other patterns that we imagine a society in which work and family are far more intermingled than today; a society in which people - businessmen artists, craftsmen, shopkeepers, professionals - work for themselves, alone and in small groups, with much more relation to their immediate surroundings than they have today. Even where the public relationship is slight, there is something to be gained, both for the worker and the community, by enlarging the connection between the two. In the case of the home workshop, the public nature of the work is especially valuable. According to the nature of the work, the public connection takes the form of a shopfront, a driveway for loading and unloading materials, a work bench in the open, a small meeting room .... Give the workshop a corner where it is especially nice to work - LIGHT ON TWO SIDES, WORKSPACE ENCLOSURE; a strong connection to the street - OPENING TO THE STREET, WINDOWS OVERLOOKING LIFE; perhaps a place to work in the sun on warm days - SUNNY PLACE.","sm_api_keyword_array":["WORK","workshop","public","street","connection"]}
