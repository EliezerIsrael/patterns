Give the house three distinct parts: a realm for parents, a realm for the children, and a common area. The children naturally want to be where the adults are; their parents don&#039;t have the heart, or the energy, to keep them out of special areas; so finally the whole house has the character of a children&#039;s room - children&#039;s clothes, drawings, boots and shoes, tricycles, toy trucks, and disarray. To help achieve a balance, a house for a small family needs three distinct areas: a couple&#039;s realm, reserved for the adults; a children&#039;s realm, where children&#039;s needs hold sway; and a common area, between the two, connected to them both. The children&#039;s world must also be looked upon as territory that they share, as children, CHILDREN&#039;S REALM; here, it is important to establish that this is a part of the house, in balance with the others. Treat the house, like every house, as a distinct piece of territory -YOUR OWN HOME; build the three main parts according to the specific patterns for those parts - COMMON AREAS AT THE HEART, COUPLE&#039;S REALM, BED CLUSTER and connect the common areas, and the bed cluster according to the CHILDREN&#039;S REALM....","sm_api_keyword_array":["children","house","part","adult","realm"]}
