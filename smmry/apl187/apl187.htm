{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"187 MARRIAGE BED","sm_api_content":" The bed is the center of a couple&#039;s life together: the place where they lie together, talk, make love, sleep, sleep late, take care of each other during illness. At the right moment in a couple&#039;s life, it is important that they make for themselves a special bed - an intimate anchor point for their lives; slightly enclosed, with a low ceiling or a canopy, with the room shaped to it; perhaps a tiny room built around the bed with many windows. There is a low ceiling, or a partial ceiling, over the bed. Find a way of adding to the bed and the space around it, so that it will become more personal and unique over the years; for example, a headboard that can be carved, painted, repainted, or a cloth ceiling that can be changed, embroidered. &quot;Strange man, I am not proud, or contemptuous, or offended, but I know what manner of man you were when you sailed away from Ithaca. Come Eurycleia, make the bed outside the room which he built himself; put the fine bedstead outside, and lay out the rugs and blankets and fleeces. Make two separate dressing rooms or alcoves near the bed - DRESSING ROOMS; for more details on the space around the bed, see BED ALCOVE; lower the ceiling over the bed - CEILING HEIGHT VARIETY, and provide some way of creating special ornament all around it - ORNAMENT.","sm_api_keyword_array":["bed","couple","make","around","ceiling"]}
