{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"23 PARALLEL ROADS","sm_api_content":" In earlier patterns, we have proposed that cities should be subdivided into local transport areas, whose roads allow cars to move in and out from the ring roads, but strongly discourage internal movement across the area - LOCAL TRANSPORT AREAS, RING ROADS - and that these transport areas themselves be further subdivided into communities and neighborhoods, with the provision that all major roads are in the boundaries between communities and neighborhoods - SUBCULTURE BOUNDARY NEIGHBORHOOD BOUNDARY. Within a local transport area build no intersecting major roads at all; instead, build a system of parallel and alternating one-way roads to carry traffic to the RING ROADS. We have argued elsewhere - LOCAL TRANSPORT AREAS - that to preserve the quality of the city&#039;s environment it is necessary to discourage the use of the automobile for very short trips, and to encourage walking, bikes, buses, and horses instead. The pattern of parallel roads has precisely the feature which local transport areas need. The parallel roads are the only through roads in a LOCAl, TRANSPORT AREA. For access from the parallel roads to public buildings, house clusters, and individual houses use safe, slow, narrow roads which are not through roads - LOOPED LOCAL ROADS, GREEN STREETS - and make their intersections with the parallel roads a &quot;T&quot; - T JUNCTION. Provide a ROAD CROSSING where paths cross the parallel roads.","sm_api_keyword_array":["road","parallel","area","trip","local"]}
