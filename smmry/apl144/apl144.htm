{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"144 BATHING ROOM","sm_api_content":"The motions we call bathing are mere ablutions which formerly preceded the bath. The place where they are performed, though adequate for the routine, does not deserve to be called a bathroom. Rudofsky points out that cleaning up is only a small part of bathing; that bathing as a whole is a far more basic activity, with therapeutic and pleasurable aspects. If we imagine a large bathing room, large enough to make bathing a pleasure, we see that we can certainly not afford more than one of them per family. Visitors must be able to use the bathing room, and must therefore be able to reach it without passing through the private rooms or bedrooms. We imagine solid unlockable doors to the bathing room as a whole; perhaps swinging doors to establish the fluidity of the area; and then opaque glass doors or curtains on the shower stall; a simple door for the toilet stalls - this is the most private spot; and an open doorway to the alcove which contains the bath. Above all, make sure that there is light, plenty of light - LIGHT ON TWO SIDES OF EVERY ROOM and FILTERED LIGHT; try to place the bathing room so that it opens out into a private part of the garden - GARDEN WALL, and perhaps even gives direct access to some local swimming pool - STILL WATER.","sm_api_keyword_array":["bath","room","bathroom","private","toilet"]}
