{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"198 CLOSETS BETWEEN ROOMS","sm_api_content":" Given the layout of rooms, it is now necessary to decide exactly where to put the built-in cupboards and closets. Use them, especially, to help form the enclosure around a workspace - WORKSPACE ENCLOSURE, around a dressing space - DRESSING ROOM, and around the doors of rather private rooms so that the doorway itself gets some depth - CORNER DOOR. Then place the closets themselves on those interior walls which lie between two rooms and between rooms and passages where you need acoustic insulation. Place them so as to create transition spaces for the doors into the rooms. When storage is placed in the interior walls of a room, around the doorway, the resulting thickness will make the transitions between rooms and corridors more distinct. For the person entering such a room, the thickness of the wall creates a subtle &quot;Entry&quot; space, which makes the room more private.","sm_api_keyword_array":["ROOM","closet","wall","space","around"]}
