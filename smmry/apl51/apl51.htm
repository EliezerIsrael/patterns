{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"51 GREEN STREETS","sm_api_content":" When overflow parking from shopping streets and work communities sprawls onto streets that were intended to be quiet neighborhoods, the character of the neighborhood is drastically altered. The neighborhood becomes a parking lot for strangers who care nothing about it, who simply store their cars there. The green street will only work if it is based on the principle that the street need not, and should not, provide for more parking than its people need. Parking for visitors can be in small parking lots at the ends of the street; parking for people in the individual houses and workshops can either be in the same parking lots or in the driveways of the buildings. Even when the street is green, it may be pleasant to put in occasional very small lanes, a few feet wide, at right angles to the green streets, according to NETWORK OF PATHS AND CARS. In order to preserve the greenness of the street, it will be essential, too, to keep parked cars in driveways on the individual lots, or in tiny parking lots, at the ends of the street, reserved for the house owners and their visitors - SMALL PARKING LOTS.","sm_api_keyword_array":["park","street","road","cars","paved"]}
