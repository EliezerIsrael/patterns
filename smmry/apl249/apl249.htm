{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"249 ORNAMENT","sm_api_content":" Corners, places where materials meet, door frames, windows, main entrances, the place where one wall meets another, the garden gate, a fence - all these are natural places which call out for ornament. Make the ornaments work as seams along the boundaries and edges so that they knit the two sides together and make them one. Further, the function is a necessary one - the ornaments are not just optional additions which may, or may not be added to a building, according as the spirit moves you - a building needs them, just as much as it needs doors and windows. Leaving aside the profound meaning of these &quot;Ornaments,&quot; it is a fact that they function mainly by creating surfaces in which each part is simultaneously figure and boundary and in which the design acts as boundary and figure at several different levels simultaneously. Without the ornament, there would be a gap between the arch of the entry and the passage itself: the ornament works on the seam, between the two, and holds them together. Use color for ornament - WARM COLORS; use the smaller trims which cover joints as ornament - HALF-INCH TRIM; and embellish the rooms themselves with parts of your life which become the natural ornaments around you - THINGS FROM YOUR LIFE....","sm_api_keyword_array":["ornament","BUILDING","BOUNDARY","EDGE","place"]}
