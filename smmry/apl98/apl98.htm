{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"98 CIRCULATION REALMS","sm_api_content":" Choose the realms so that each one can be easily named, so that you can tell a person where to go, simply by telling him which realms to go through. The map guides you to the entrance of the largest realm, and from there to the entrance of the next largest realm, and so on. The realms are: Manhattan, Districts, Realms defined by the avenues, and Realms defined by cross streets and individual buildings. Each realm has a main circulation space, which opens directly from the entrances to that realm. The entrances to any realm open directly off the circulation space of the next larger realm above it. Treat the first entrances to the whole system of circulation realms, the very largest ones, as gateways - MAIN GATEWAYS; make the major realms, which open off the gateways, pedestrian streets or common land - COMMON LAND, PEDESTRIAN STREET; then, make minor realms with individual buildings, and courtyards, and major indoor streets - MAIN BUILDING, BUILDING THOROUGHFARE, HIERARCHY OF OPEN SPACE, COURTYARDS WHICH LIVE; and mark the entrance to these minor realms with minor entrances that still stand out quite clearly - FAMILY OF ENTRANCES, MAIN ENTRANCE.","sm_api_keyword_array":["realm","build","person","map","make"]}
