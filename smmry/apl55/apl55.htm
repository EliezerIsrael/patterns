{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"55 RAISED WALK","sm_api_content":" Where fast moving cars and pedestrians meet in cities, the cars overwhelm the pedestrians. On an ordinary street, cars make pedestrians feel small and vulnerable because the sidewalks are too narrow and too low. When the car is down low and the pedestrian world physically higher, pedestrians feel, symbolically, that they are more important than the cars and therefore feel secure. For the pedestrian to feel certain that a car could not climb the curb, the curb height would have to be greater than the radius of a car tire. Although tall people can see over cars, even for them, the cars fill the landscape since a standing person&#039;s normal line of sight is 10 degrees below the horizontal. To put a car 12 feet away completely below a pedestrian&#039;s line of sight, it would have to be on a road some 18 to 30 inches below the pedestrian.","sm_api_keyword_array":["car","pedestrian","road","walk","feel"]}
