When the light is perfectly even, the social function of the space gets utterly destroyed: it even becomes difficult for people to form natural human groups. If a group is in an area of uniform illumination, there are no light gradients corresponding to the boundary of the group, so the definition, cohesiveness, and &quot;Existence&quot; of the group will be weakened. These authors conclude that local lighting over a work table allows the worker to pay more attention to his work than uniform background lighting does. We know of many failures: for example, places where small lights do break down even illumination, but do not correspond in any real way with the places where people tend to gather in the space.
