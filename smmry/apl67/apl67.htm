{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"67 COMMON LAND","sm_api_content":" Just as there is a need for public land at the neighborhood level - ACCESSIBLE GREEN, so also, within the clusters and work communities from which the neighborhoods are made, there is a need for smaller and more private kinds of common land shared by a few work groups or a few families. Give over 25 per cent of the land in house clusters to common land which touches, or is very very near, the homes which share it. In pre-industrial societies, common land between houses and between workshops existed automatically - so it was never necessary to make a point of it. Common land provides a meeting ground for the fluid, common activities that a house cluster shares. Enough land must be common so that private land doesn&#039;t dominate it psychologically. Shape the common land so it has some enclosure and good sunlight - SOUTH FACING OUTDOORS, POSITIVE OUTDOOR SPACE; and so that smaller and more private pieces of land and pockets always open onto it -HIERARCHY OF OPEN SPACE; provide communal functions within the land - PUBLIC OUTDOOR ROOM, LOCAL SPORTS, VEGETABLE GARDEN; and connect the different and adjacent pieces of common land to one another to form swaths of connected play space - CONNECTED PLAY.","sm_api_keyword_array":["land","common","HOUSE","build","function"]}
