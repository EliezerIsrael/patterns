{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"13 SUBCULTURE BOUNDARY","sm_api_content":" The MOSAlC OF SUBCULTURES and its individual subcultures, whether they are COMMUNITIES OF 7000 or IDENTIFlABLE NEIGHBORHOODS, need to be completed by boundaries. In MOSAlC OF SUBCULTURES we have argued that a great variety of subcultures in a city is not a racist pattern which forms ghettos, but a pattern of opportunity which allows a city to contain a multitude of different ways of life with the greatest possible intensity. Obviously, a rich mix of subcultures will not be possible if each subculture is being inhibited by pressure from its neighbors. If we look around a metropolitan area, and pinpoint the strongly differentiated subcultures, those with character, we shall always find that they are near boundaries and hardly ever close to other communities. In just the same way, differentiation between subcultures in a city will be able to take place most easily when the flow of those elements which account for cultural variety - values, style, information, and so on - is at least partially restricted between neighboring subcultures. The interior organization of the subculture boundary should follow two broad principles.","sm_api_keyword_array":["subculture","area","land","boundary","between"]}
