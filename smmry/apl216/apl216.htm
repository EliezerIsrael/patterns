{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"216 BOX COLUMNS","sm_api_content":" If you use ROOT FOUNDATIONS, the columns must be made at the same time as the foundations, since the foundation and the column are integral. A column which has all these features is a box column, where the hollow tube can be made as thick as is required, and then filled with a strong compressive material. Such a column can be made cheaper than comparable wood and steel columns; the outer skin can be made with a material that is beautiful, easy to repair, and soft to the touch; the column can be stiffened for bending, either by the skin itself, or by extra reinforcing; and, for structural integrity, the fill material can be made continuous with the column&#039;s footings and beams. Some wire reinforcing inside the column is required to give the column tensile strength. Once the columns are in position, put in the PERIMETER BEAMS, and fill the beams at the same time that you fill the upper part of the column. If the column is free standing, put in column braces or column capitals - COLUMN CONNECTION - to brace the connection between the two.","sm_api_keyword_array":["column","fill","concrete","made","material"]}
