{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"155 OLD AGE COTTAGE","sm_api_content":" We have explained, in OLD PEOPLE EVERYWHERE, that it is essential to have a balanced number of old people in every neighborhood, partly centered around a communal place, but largely strung out among the other houses of the neighborhood. Like ROOMS TO RENT and TEENAGER&#039;S COTTAGE, this cottage can be rented out or used for other purposes in time of trouble. In all cases, place these cottages at ground level, right on the street, where people are walking by, and close to neighborhood services and common land. The conflict can be partly resolved, if each house which houses a nuclear family has, somewhere near it, a small cottage where a grandparent can live, far enough away to be independent, and yet close enough to feel some tie and to be cared for in a time of trouble or approaching death. Many of the old people in our society are forced to live in miserable tiny rooms, way in the back of some run-down old folks hotel. Perhaps the most important part of an old age cottage is the front porch and front door bench outside the door, right on the street - PRIVATE TERRACE ON THE STREET, FRONT DOOR BENCH; for the rest, arrange the cottage pretty much according to the layout of any HOUSE FOR ONE PERSON; make provisions for SETTLED WORK; and give the cottage a STREET WINDOW.","sm_api_keyword_array":["cottage","house","OLD","PEOPLE","conflict"]}
