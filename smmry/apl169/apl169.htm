{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"169 TERRACED SLOPE","sm_api_content":" On all land which slopes - in fields, in parks, in public gardens, even in the private gardens around a house - make a system of terraces and bunds which follow the contour lines. Make them by building low walls along the contour lines, and then backfilling them with earth to form the terraces. There is no reason why the building itself should fit into the terraces - it can comfortably cross terrace lines. The pattern of terracing makes as much sense on a small house lot as it does on the hills around a valley. Once the terracing has been accomplished, the building can fit to it, and stretch across the lines of the terrace. The new way is to make &quot;Terrace fields.&quot; The rocks are dynamited to get the needed building materials.","sm_api_keyword_array":["terrace","make","BUILDING","plant","lines"]}
