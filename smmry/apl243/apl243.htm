{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"243 SITTING WALL","sm_api_content":" If you have also marked the places where it makes sense to build seats - SEAT SPOTS, FRONT DOOR BENCH - you can kill two birds with one stone by using the walls as seats which help enclose the outdoor space wherever its positive character is weakest. In many places walls and fences between outdoor spaces are too high; but no boundary at all does injustice to the subtlety of the divisions between the spaces. Surround any natural outdoor area, and make minor boundaries between outdoor areas with low walls, about 16 inches high, and wide enough to sit on, at least 12 inches wide. If there is a high wall or a hedge, then the people in the garden have no way of being connected to the street; the people in the street have no way of being connected to the garden. A low wall or balustrade, just at the right height for sitting, is perfect. Examples: A low wall with the children&#039;s sandbox on one side, circulation path on the other; low wall at the front of the garden, connecting the house to the public path; a sitting wall that is a retaining wall, with plants on one side, where people can sit close to the flowers and eat their lunch.","sm_api_keyword_array":["wall","GARDEN","between","sit","STREET"]}
