Make the windows smaller and smaller, as you go higher in the building. Although there is no constraint on the exact dimension of the windows, there is a general rule of thumb, which will make window sizes vary: Windows, as a rule, should become smaller as you get higher up in the building. The area of windows needed for light and ventilation depends on the size of rooms, and rooms are generally smaller on upper stories of the building - the communal rooms are generally on the ground floor and more private rooms upstairs. The amount of daylight coming through a window depends on the area of open sky visible through the window. The higher the window, the more open sky is visible - so less window area is needed to get sufficient daylight in.","sm_api_keyword_array":["WINDOW","building","Make","door","SMALL"]}
