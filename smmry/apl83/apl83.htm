{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"83 MASTER AND APRENTICES","sm_api_content":" Arrange the work in every workgroup, industry, and office, in such a way that work and learning go forward hand in hand. Treat every piece of work as an opportunity for learning. In the twelfth century young people learned by working beside masters - helping them, making contact directly with every corner of society. The floors of the building are made up of laboratories, each one under the direction of a professor of biology, each with two or three small rooms opening directly off the lab for graduate students working under the professor&#039;s direction. The practice of law, architecture, medicine, the building trades, social services, engineering - each discipline has the potential to set up its ways of learning, and therefore the environments in which its practitioners work, along these lines. Keep workgroups small, and give every group a common area, a common meeting space, and a place where they can eat together - COMMON AREAS AT THE HEART, COMMUNAL EATING, SMALL WORK GROUPS, SMALL MEETING ROOMS.","sm_api_keyword_array":["work","learn","master","helps","small"]}
