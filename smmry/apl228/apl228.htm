{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"228 STAIR VAULT","sm_api_content":" How to build a stair in a way which is consistent with the compressive structure of EFFICIENT STRUCTURE, without using wood or steel or concrete - GOOD MATERIALS?. Within a building technology which uses compressive materials as much as possible, and excludes the use of wood, it is natural to build stairs over a vaulted void, simply to save weight and materials. Build a curved diagonal vault in the same way that you build your FLOOR-CEILING VAULTS. For the reasons already given in GOOD MATERIALS, precast concrete and steel are undesirable materials to use - they call for modular planning; they are unpleasant materials to touch, look at, and walk on; they are hard to work with and modify in any relaxed way, since they call for special tools. Given the principles of EFFICIENT STRUCTURE, GOOD MATERIALS, and GRADUAL STIFFENING, we suggest that stairs be made like FLOOR-CEILING VAULTS - by making a half-vault, with lattice strips, burlap, resin, chickenwire, and lightweight concrete. The vaulted space under the stair can be used as an ALCOVE, a CHILD CAVE, or CLOSETS BETWEEN ROOMS.","sm_api_keyword_array":["vault","stair","MATERIALS","concrete","build"]}
