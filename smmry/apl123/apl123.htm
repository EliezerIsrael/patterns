{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"123 PEDESTRIAN DENSITY","sm_api_content":" In various places there are pedestrian areas, paved so that people will congregate there or walk up and down - PROMENADE, SMALL PUBLIC SQUARES, PEDESTRIAN STREET, BUILDING THOROUGHFARE, PATH SHAPE. For public squares, courts, pedestrian streets, any place where crowds are drawn together, estimate the mean number of people in the place at any given moment, and make the area of the place between 150P and 300P square feet. We do not say categorically that the number of people per square foot controls the apparent liveliness of a pedestrian area. Per person Golden Gate Plaza, noon: 1000 Dead Fresno Mall: 100 Alive Sproul Plaza, daytime: 150 Alive Sproul Plaza, evening: 2000 Dead Union Square, central part: 600 Half-dead. Although these subjective estimates are clearly open to question, they suggest the following rule of thumb: At 150 square feet per person, an area is lively. If there are more than 500 square feet per person, the area begins to be dead. Even if these figures are only correct to within an order of magnitude, we can use them to shape public pedestrian areas - squares, indoor streets, shopping streets, promenades. Then we shall want the front of this market to form a little square, no larger than 450 square feet.","sm_api_keyword_array":["square","area","people","place","estimate"]}
