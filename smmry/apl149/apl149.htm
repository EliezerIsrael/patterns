{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"149 RECEPTION WELCOMES YOU","sm_api_content":" Place the reception desk so that it is not between the receptionist and the welcoming area, but to one side at an angle - so that she, or he, can get up and walk toward the people who come in, greet them, and then invite them to sit down. In most institutions the person arriving has to go toward the receptionist; the receptionist remains passive and offers nothing. To be welcoming the receptionist must initiate the action - come forward and greet the person, offer a chair, food, a seat by the fire, coffee. The receptionist comes forward from an inner office, invites you to sit down in a com fortable chair at one of these writing desks, and sits down with you while you fill out the hotel register. The reasons most reception areas fail completely to have this quality, is that the receptionist&#039;s desk forms a barrier, so that the desk and equipment together help to create an institutional atmosphere, quite at odds with the feeling of welcome. Place the fireplace most carefully, to be a focus - THE FIRE give the receptionist a workspace where she can be comfortable in her own work, and still make visitors feel welcome WORKSPACE ENCLOSURE; give the space LIGHT ON TWO SIDES; perhaps put in an alcove or a window seat for people who are waiting - A PLACE TO WAIT, ALCOVES, WINDOW PLACE.","sm_api_keyword_array":["receptionist","desk","welcome","place","come"]}
