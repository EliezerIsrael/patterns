{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"156 SETTLED WORK","sm_api_content":" First of all, what do we mean by &quot;Settled work&quot;? It is the work which unites all the threads of a person&#039;s life into one activity: the activity becomes a complete and wholehearted extension of the person behind it. There is the bureaucrat who finally breaks through all the paper work and finds the underlying organic function in his work. Even in the self-governing workshops and offices, where working procedures are created ad hoc by the workers as they go, the work itself is generally geared to the demands of the marketplace. To solve the problem, we must first of all create a working environment, where a person, from say middle age, has the opportunity of slowly developing a kind of settled work that is right for him. If the time is increased gradually over the years, a person can explore various kinds of work; and gradually let the settled work replace his working life. We make special mention of settled work as the work of old age, because, even though it must begin early on in a person&#039;s life, it is in old age that having such work becomes a necessity.","sm_api_keyword_array":["work","life","person","settled","OLD"]}
