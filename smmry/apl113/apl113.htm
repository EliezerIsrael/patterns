{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"113 CAR CONNECTION","sm_api_content":" Once you have the entrance of the building fixed and its transition clear - MAIN ENTRANCE, ENTRANCE TRANSITION - it is necessary to work out how a person can approach the building by car. Place the parking place for the car and the main entrance, in such a relation to each other, that the shortest route from the parked car into the house, both to the kitchen and to the living rooms, is always through the main entrance. Make the parking place for the car into an actual room which makes a positive and graceful place where the car stands, not just a gap in the terrain. Since people always try to use the door nearest the car, the entrance nearest the parking spot always becomes the &quot;Main&quot; entrance, even if it was not planned that way. For families with cars, the back door, being on the car side, dominates exit and entry, yet visitors are &quot;Supposed&quot; to come to the front door. For some reason, even though the car is so important to the way of life in a modern house, the place where car and house meet is almost never treated seriously as a beautiful and significant place in its own right.","sm_api_keyword_array":["car","entrance","house","place","door"]}
