{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"37 HOUSE CLUSTER","sm_api_content":" Gans&#039; data underscore our intuitions: people want to be part of a neighborly spatial cluster; contact between people sharing such a cluster is a vital function. What about the size of the cluster? What is the appropriate size? In Gans&#039; investigations each home stands at the center of a cluster of five or six other homes. Of course, the average size for clusters might be less, perhaps around 6 or 8; and clusters of 3, 4, or 5 homes can work perfectly well. In a new neighborhood, with houses built on the ground, we imagine quite dramatic clusters, with the houses built around or to the side of common land; and with a core to the cluster that gradually tapers off at the edges. We advocate a system of ownership where the deed to one home carries with it part ownership in the cluster to which the home belongs; and ideally, this in turn carries with it part owner ship in the neighborhood made up of several clusters. Arrange paths clearly - CIRCULATION REALMS - and lay these paths out in such a way that they create busier paths and backwaters, even within the cluster - DEGREES OF PUBLICNESS; keep parking in SMALL PARKING LOTS, and make the houses in the cluster suit the households which will live there - THE FAMILY, HOUSE FOR A SMALL FAMILY, HOUSE FOR A COUPLE, HOUSE FOR ONE PERSON, YOUR OWN HOME....","sm_api_keyword_array":["cluster","house","land","home","neighborhood"]}
