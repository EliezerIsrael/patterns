{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"8 MOSAIC OF SUBCULTURES","sm_api_content":"People can choose the kind of subculture they wish to live in, and can still experience many ways of life different from their own. In a society where people have trouble finding their own selves, people will seem homogeneous, there will be less variety, and character will be weak. Faced constantly with an unpredictable changing social world, people no longer generate the strength to draw on themselves; they draw more and more on the approval of others; they look to see whether people are smiling when they say something, and if they are, they go on saying it, and if not, they shut up. &quot;Mass society not only creates a confusing situation in which people find it hard to find themselves - it also ... creates chaos, in which people are confronted by impossible variety - the variety becomes a slush, which then concentrates merely on the most obvious. Self-actualisation will only be able to happen when this fear is overcome; and that in turn, can only happen, when people are in familiar territory, among people of their own kind, whose habits and ways they know, and whom they trust. People who want to ride horses all need open riding; Germans who want to be able to buy German food may congregate together, as they do around German town, New York; old people may need parks to sit in, less traffic to contend with, nearby nursing services; bachelors may need quick snack food places; Armenians who want to go to the orthodox mass every morning will cluster around an Armenian church; street people collect around their stores and meeting places; people with many small children will be able to collect around local nurseries and open play space.","sm_api_keyword_array":["people","subculture","character","own","different"]}
