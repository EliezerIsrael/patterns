Do not consider door and window frames as separate rigid structures which are inserted into holes in walls. Think of them instead as thickenings of the very fabric of the wall itself, made to protect the wall against the concentrations of stress which develop around openings. In line with this conception, build the frames as thickenings of the wall material, continuous with the wall itself, made of the same materials, and poured, or built up, in a manner which is continuous with the structure of the wall. Where the walls are made of wood planks and lightweight concrete fill - ess WALL MEMBRANES - the thickened frames can be made from the same wood planks, placed to form a bulge, and then filled to be continuous with the wall. In windows, splay the thickening, to create DEEP REVEALS; the form of doors and windows which will fill the frame, is given by the later patterns - WINDOWS WHICH OPEN WIDE, SOLID DOORS WITH GLASS, SMALL PANES....","sm_api_keyword_array":["wall","thickened","window","hole","around"]}
