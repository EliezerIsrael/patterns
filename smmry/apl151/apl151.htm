{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"151 SMALL MEETING ROOMS","sm_api_content":" Make at least 70 per cent of all meeting rooms really small - for 12 people or less. Most of these meetings are held in rooms designed for far more than 15 people. Finally, the spatial distribution of meeting rooms is often as poorly adapted to the actual meetings as the size distribution. The meeting rooms are not located where people work. The meetings work best when the meeting rooms are fairly near the participants&#039; offices. Shape meeting rooms like any other rooms, perhaps with special emphasis on the fact that there must be no glare - LIGHT ON TWO SIDES OF EVERY ROOM - and on the fact that the rooms should be roughly round or square, and not too long or narrow - SITTING CIRCLE.","sm_api_keyword_array":["meeting","ROOM","people","size","group"]}
