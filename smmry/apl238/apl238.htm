{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"238 FILTERED LIGHT","sm_api_content":" Where the edge of a window or the overhanging eave of a roof is silhouetted against the sky, make a rich, detailed taspestry of light and dark, to break up the light and soften it. For all these reasons, we have a natural desire to diffuse light with lamp shades or indirect lighting, so that the images created by the light will be &quot;Softer,&quot; that is, that the boundaries perceived are not sharp, there is less contrast, fewer shadows, and the details are easier to see. When there is bright light coming in through the window, it creates glare against the darkness of the wall around the window -see DEEP REVEALS. Filtering the light especially at the edges of the window cuts down the glare by letting in less light. To create filtered light, partially cover those windows which get direct sunlight, with vines and lattices. The edge of the window can have fine tracery - that is, the edge of the glass itself, not the frame, so that the light coming in is gradually stronger from the edge to the center of the window; the tracery is best toward the top of the window where the light is strongest.","sm_api_keyword_array":["light","window","contrast","edge","make"]}
