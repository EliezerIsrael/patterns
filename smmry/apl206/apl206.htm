{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"206 EFFICIENT STRUCTURE","sm_api_content":" In its geometry, conceive it as a three-dimensional system of individually vaulted spaces, most of them roughly rectangular; with thin load-bearing walls, each stiffened by columns at intervals along its length, thickened where walls meet walls and where walls meet vaults and stiffened around the openings. Right angles tend to create discontinuities: forces can be distributed throughout the building only if there are diagonal fillets wherever walls meet ceilings, walls meet walls, and columns meet beams. The wall provides it naturally; and the continuity of the walls, floor, and ceiling can only be created by the action of a wall that ties them together. Connections between walls and floors, and between walls and walls, must all be thickened by extra material that forms a fillet along the seam. We know from THE SHAPE OF INDOOR SPACE that we cannot avoid rough right angles where walls meet walls; and of course, there must be rough right angles where walls meet floors. The layout of the stiffeners which make the walls is given in FINAL COLUMN DISTRIBUTION; the layout of the thickening where walls meet walls is given by COLUMNS AT THE CORNERS; the thickening where walls meet vaults is given by PERIMETER BEAMS; the construction of the columns and the walls is given by BOX COLUMNS and WALL MEMBRANES; the thickening of doors and window frames is given by FRAMES AS THICKENED EDGES; and the non- right-angled connection between columns and beams by COLUMN CONNECTION....","sm_api_keyword_array":["wall","STRUCTURE","material","building","space"]}
