{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"90 BEER HALL","sm_api_content":" Where can people sing, and drink, and shout and drink, and let go of their sorrows? A public drinking house, where strangers and friends are drinking companions, is a natural part of any large community. V. S. Pritchett describes the lonely men in New York City sitting speechlessly on a row of barstools, with their arms triangled on the bar before a bottle of beer, their drinking money before them. Another visiting Englishman makes the same point when he describes the American bar as a &quot;Hoked up saloon; the atmosphere is as chilly as the beer ... when I asked a stranger to have a drink, he looked at me as if I were mad. In England if a guy&apos;s a stranger, ... each guy buys the other a drink. You enjoy each other&#039;s company, and everyone is happy.... Let us consider drinking more in the style of these English pubs. Drink helps people to relax and become open with one another, to sing and dance.","sm_api_keyword_array":["drink","people","group","bar","neighborhood"]}
