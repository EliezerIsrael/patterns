{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"134 ZEN VIEW","sm_api_content":" How should we make the most of a view? It turns out that the pattern which answers this question helps to govern not the rooms and windows in a building, but the places of transition. If there is a beautiful view, don&#039;t spoil it by building huge windows that gape incessantly at it. If the view window is correctly placed, people will see a glimpse of the distant view as they come up to the window or pass it: but the view is never visible from the places where people stay. Even for the man who lives there, coming past that view day after day for fifty years, it will still be alive. Put in the windows to complete the indirectness of the view - NATURAL DOORS AND WINDOWS place them to help the TAPESTRY OF LIGHT AND DARK and build a seat from which a person can enjoy the view - WINDOW PLACE.
