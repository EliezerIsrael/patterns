{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"47 HEALTH CENTER","sm_api_content":" The explicit recognition of the life cycle as the basis for every individual life will do a great deal to help people&#039;s health in the community - LIFE CYCLE; this pattern describes the more specific institutions which help people to care for themselves and their health. Gradually develop a network of small health centers, perhaps one per community of 7000, across the city; each equippect to treat everyday disease both mental and physical, in children and adults - but organized essentially around a functional emphasis on those recreational and educational activities which help keep people in good health, like swimming anc dancmg. A system of health care which is actually capable of keeping people healthy, in both mind and body, must put its emphasis on health, not sickness. There is converging evidence and speculation in the health care literature that health centers with these characteristics, organized according to the philosophy of health maintenance, are critical. The conception of health which is created by this multi-phasic program is still &quot;Freedom from sickness.&quot; It is essentially negative There is no effort made toward the positive creation and maintenance of actual, blooming, health. The only health center we know which actually devoted itself to health instead of sickness was the famous Peckham Health Center in England.","sm_api_keyword_array":["health","cent","people","sickness","swimming"]}
