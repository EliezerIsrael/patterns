{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"212 COLUMNS AT THE CORNERS","sm_api_content":" Whether you conceive these plans out on the site - and mark them on the site with sticks and stones and chalk marks - or draw them roughly on the back of envelopes or scraps of tracing paper - in all events, the richness which you want to build into the plan can only be preserved if the builder is able to generate a living building, with all its slightly uneven lines and imperfect angles. These columns will then generate the rest of the building, by their mere presence, without any further need for detailed measurements or drawings, because the walls will simply be built along the lines which connect adjacent columns: and everything else follows. As you will see from FINAL COLUMN DISTRIBUTION, upper story columns do not need to line up perfectly with downstairs columns. Once you have the columns for each floor on your vault plan, reconcile them from floor to floor and put in intermediate columns - FINAL COLUMN DISTRIBUTION. These columns will not only guide your mental image of the building, they will also guide construction: first put the columns and the column foundations in place; then, to make the frame complete, tie the columns together around each room with the perimeter beam - ROOT FOUNDATIONS, BOX COLUMNS, PERIMETER BEAMS. Give special emphasis to all free-standing columns with the idea that when you build them, you will make them very thick - COLUMN PLACE....","sm_api_keyword_array":["build","column","space","draw","corner"]}
