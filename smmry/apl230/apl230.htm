{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"230 RADIANT HEAT","sm_api_content":" In most places, we get heat in all three ways from our environment: conducted heat from the solids we touch, convected heat in the air around us, and radiated heat from those sources of radiation in our line of sight. Of the three, conducted heat is trivial, since any surface hot enough to conduct heat to us directly is too hot for comfort. As far as the other two are concerned - convected heat and radiant heat - we may ask whether there is any biological difference in their effects on human beings. Hot air systems, and buried pipes, and the so-called hot water &quot;Radiators&quot; do transmit some of their heat to us by means of radiation, but most of the heat we get from them comes from convection. The conditions in which people feel most comfortable require a subtle balance of convected heat and radiant heat. Radiant panels, with individual room control, and infrared heaters hung from walls and ceilings, are possible high technology sources of radiant heat.","sm_api_keyword_array":["heat","radiant","temperature","surface","air"]}
