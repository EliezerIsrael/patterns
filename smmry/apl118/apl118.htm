{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"118 ROOF GARDEN","sm_api_content":" In between the sloping roofs created by SHELTERING ROOF, the roofs are flat where people can walk out on them. Place the roof gardens at various stories, and always make it possible to walk directly out onto the roof garden from some lived-in part of the building. As we know from SHELTERING ROOF and ROOF VAULTS, the flat shape is quite unnatural for roofs from psychological, structural, and climatic points of view. We shall expect that this pattern will generate a roof landscape in which roof gardens and steep roofs are mixed in almost every building. To make the flat parts of roofs truly useful, and compatible with the need for sloping roofs, it seems necessary to build flat roof gardens off the indoor parts of the buildings. In any case, place the roof garden so that it is sheltered from the wind - SUNNY PLACE, and give part of the roof some extra kind of shelter - perhaps a canvas awning - so that people can stay on the roof but keep out of the hot sun - CANVAS ROOFS.","sm_api_keyword_array":["ROOF","garden","part","flat","Place"]}
