{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"138 SLEEPING TO THE EAST","sm_api_content":" People&#039;s attitude to this pattern often runs along the following lines: &quot;The pattern suggests that I should sleep somewhere where the sun can wake me up; but I don&#039;t want the sun to wake me up; I want to be able to sleep late, whenever I can. I guess I have a different style of life; so the pattern doesn&#039;t apply to me. If we wake up immediately after a period of dreaming, we will feel ebullient, energetic, and refreshed for the whole day, because certain critical hormones are injected into the bloodstream immediately after REM sleep. Now, obviously, anyone who is woken by an alarm clock, will sometimes be woken in the middle of delta sleep and will, on those days, have a lethargic day; and will sometimes wake up just after REM sleep and will, on those days, have an energetic day. Now, the only way to make sure that you wake up at the right time, with the closure of REM sleep, is to wake up naturally. You can only wake up naturally, and in accordance with the other, larger cycle of metabolic activity, if you wake up with the sun. The sun warms you, increases the light, gently nudges you to wake up - but in a way that is so gentle, that you will still actually wake up at the moment which serves you best - that is, just after a dream.","sm_api_keyword_array":["wake","sleep","sun","day","bed"]}
