{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"19 WEB OF SHOPPING","sm_api_content":" Within the gap in the web of similar shops, locate your shop next to the largest cluster of other kinds of shops. New shops which could provide these services often locate near the other shops and major centers, instead of locating themselves where they are needed. In an ideal town, where the shops are seen as part of the society&#039;s necessities and not merely as a way of making profit for the shopping chains, the shops would be much more widely and more hornogeneously distributed than they are today. In present cities, shops of similar types tend to be clustered in shopping centers. Of course, there will still be competition, enough to make sure that very bad shops go out of business, because each shop will be capable of drawing customers from the nearby catch basins if it offers better service - but the accent is on cooperation instead of competition. If we follow the rules of location given above - always locating a new shop in the biggest gap in the web of similar shops - then, within that gap there are still quite a large number of different possible places to locate: and naturally, we shall try to locate near the largest cluster of other shops within that gap, to increase the number of people coming past the shop, in short, to make it more convenient for shoppers.","sm_api_keyword_array":["shop","locate","market","web","New"]}
