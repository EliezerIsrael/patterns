{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"245 RAISED FLOWERS","sm_api_content":" Outdoors there are various low walls at sitting height - SITTING WALL; terraced gardens, if the garden has a natural slope in it - TERRACED SLOPE; and paths and steps and crinkled building edges - PATHS AND GOALS, STAIR SEATS, BUILDING EDGE, GARDEN WALLThese are the best spots for flowers, and flowers help to make them beautiful. Flowers are beautiful along the edges of paths, buildings, outdoor rooms - but it is just in these places that they need the most protection from traffic. Soften the edges of buildings, paths, and outdoor areas with flowers. Raise the flower beds so that people can touch the flowers, bend to smell them, and sit by them. Build the flower beds with solid edges, so that people can sit on them, among the flowers too. Make quite certain that the flowers are placed in positions where people really can enjoy them - and not simply as ornament: outside favorite windows, along traveled paths, near entrances and round doorways, by outdoor seats.","sm_api_keyword_array":["flower","paths","EDGE","people","Build"]}
