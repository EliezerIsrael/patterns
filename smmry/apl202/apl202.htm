{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"202 BUILT-IN SEATS","sm_api_content":" Throughout the building - SEQUENCE OF SITTING SPACES - there are alcoves, entrances, corners, and windows where it is natural to make built-in seats - ENTRANCE ROOM, ALCOVES, WINDOW PLACE. Before you build the seat, get hold of an old arm chair or a sofa, and put it into the position where you intend to build a seat. Now build a seat that is just as wide, and just as well padded - and your built-in seat will work. Why do built-in seats so often not work properly? The reasons are simple and fairly easy to correct. If you want to build a seat, ask yourself where you would place a sofa or a comfortable armchair-and build the seat there, not tucked into some hopeless corner. Built-in seats often place you so that you are facing away from the view or away from the other people in the room.","sm_api_keyword_array":["seat","build","built-in","where","too"]}
