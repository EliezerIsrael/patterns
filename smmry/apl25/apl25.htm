{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"25 ACCESS TO WATER","sm_api_content":" The very movement of the people toward the water can also destroy the water. Allow dense settlements to come right down to the water only at infrequent intervals along the water&#039;s edge. Either roads, freeways, and industries destroy the water&#039;s edge and make it so dirty or so treacherous that it is virtually inaccessible; or when the water&#039;s edge is preserved, it falls into private hands. The problem can be solved only if it is understood that people will build places near the water because it is entirely natural; but that the land immediately along the water&#039;s edge must be preserved for common use. The width of the belt of land along the water may vary with the type of water, the density of development along it, and the ecological conditions. In any case, do not build roads along the water within one mile of the water; instead, make all the approach roads at right angles to the edge, and very far apart -PARALLEL ROADS.","sm_api_keyword_array":["water","along","edge","may","roads"]}
