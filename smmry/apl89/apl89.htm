{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"89 CORNER GROCERY","sm_api_content":" Give every neighborhood at least one corner grocery, somewhere near its heart. Place these corner groceries every 200 to 8oo yards, according to the density, so that each one serves about 1000 people. Strong support for this notion comes from a study by Arthur D. Little, Inc., which found that neighborhood stores are one of the two most important elements in people&#039;s perception of an area as a neighborhood(Community Renewal Program,New York: Praeger Press, 1966). To find out how far people will walk to a store we interviewed 20 people at a neighborhood store in Berkeley. San Francisco, a city Of 750,000, has 638 neighborhood grocery stores. One might even take this figure as a lower limit for a viable neighborhood, on the grounds that a neighborhood ought to be able to support a corner grocery, for the sake of its own social cohesion.","sm_api_keyword_array":["neighborhood","people","grocery","corner","store"]}
