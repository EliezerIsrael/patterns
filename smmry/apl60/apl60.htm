{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"60 ACCESSIBLE GREEN","sm_api_content":" At the heart of neighborhoods, and near all work cominunities, there need to be small greens - IDENTIFIABLE NEIGHBORHOOD, WORK COMMUNITY Of course it makes the most sense to locate these greens in such a way that they help form the boundaries and neighborhoods and backs - SUBCULTURE BOUNDARY, NEIGHBORHOOD BOUNDARY, QUIET BACKS. People need green open places to go to; when they are close they use them. If the greens are more than three minutes away, the distance overwhelms the need. It is as if those people with ready access to a green display a full, free responsiveness to it; while people far away have lost their awareness of it and have suffered a reduced sensitivity to the pleasures of the green - for these people, the green has ceased to be a vital element in their neighborhood life. The people who live more than three minutes walk from the green also need the relaxation, presumably. Pay special attention to old trees, look after them - TREE PLACES; shape the green so that it forms one or more positive room-like spaces and surround it with trees, or walls, or buildings, but not roads or cars - POSITIVE OUTDOOR SPACE, GARDEN WALL; and perhaps set aside some part of the green for special community functions - HOLY GROUND, GRAVE SITES, LOCAL SPORTS, ANIMALS, SLEEPING IN PUBLIC....","sm_api_keyword_array":["green","People","need","park","three"]}
