{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"162 NORTH FACE","sm_api_content":" Even if the building has been correctly placed according to SOUTH-FACING OUTDOORS and there is little outdoor space toward the north, there is usually still some kind of area or volume on the north face of the building. Look at the north sides of the buildings which you know. Make the north face of the building a cascade which slopes down to the ground, so that the sun which normally casts a long shadow to the north strikes the ground immediately beside the building. If a building has a sheer north face, during many months of the year it will cast a long shadow out behind it.... If there are north rooms that are inevitably gloomy, it helps enormously to make a reflecting wall: a wall standing some ways to the north of the building, painted white or yellow, and set in a position which gets the sun and reflects it back into the building. Use the triangle inside this north cascade for car, garbage, storage, shed, a studio which requires north light, closets - those parts of the building which can do very well without interior sunlight - CAR CONNECTION, BULK STORAGE, COMPOST, CLOSETS BETWEEN ROOMS.","sm_api_keyword_array":["north","building","wall","area","place"]}
