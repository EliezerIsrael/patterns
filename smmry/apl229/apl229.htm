{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"229 DUCT SPACE","sm_api_content":" In a building built according to the principle, of EFFICIENT STRUCTURE and built with vaulted floors - FLOOR-CEILING VAULTS, there is a triangular volume, unused, around the edge of every room. Make ducts to carry hot air conduit, plumbing, gas, and other services in the triangular space, within the vault, around the upper edge of every room. Connect the ducts for different rooms by vertical ducts, in special chases, in the corners of rooms. In most buildings electric conduits, plumbing, drains, gas pipes, telephone wires, and so on, are buried in the walls, in a completely uncoordinated and disorganized way. This makes the initial construction of the building complicated since it is difficult to coordinate the installation of the various services with the building of various parts of the building. Heating and electrical conduits will be universal throughout the building and should thus be run around every room.","sm_api_keyword_array":["Build","room","conduit","duct","vault"]}
