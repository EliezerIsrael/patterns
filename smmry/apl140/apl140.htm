{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"140 PRIVATE TERRACE ON THE STREET","sm_api_content":" The relationship of a house to a street is often confused: either the house opens entirely to the street and there is no privacy; or the house turns its back on the street, and communion with street life is lost. Let the common rooms open onto a wide terrace or a porch which looks into the street. Raise the terrace slightly above street level and protect it with a low wall, which you can see over if you sit near it, but which prevents people on the street from looking into the common rooms. Where the street is quiet enough, and the house near enough to the street, we cannot imagine a much better solution. When he built beside lively streets he built a wide terrace between the living room and the street. There are empirical grounds for believing that the need for a house to be in touch with the street outside is a fundamental psychological necessity: and that its opposite - the tendency some people have to keep their houses away from the street, locked up, barred, and disconnected from the street - is a symptom of a serious emotional disorder - the autonomy-withdrawal syndrome.","sm_api_keyword_array":["street","house","terrace","wall","room"]}
