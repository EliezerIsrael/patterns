{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"43 UNIVERSITY AS MARKETPLACE","sm_api_content":" Establish the university as a marketplace of higher education. By contrast, the isolated and over-administered university of today kills the variety and intensity of the different ideas at the university and also limits the student&#039;s opportunity to shop for ideas. In a university marketplace, anyone can come forward and offer a course. The university marketplace needs a physical structure to support its social structure. Finally, how should a university marketplace be administered? We don&#039;t know. The Open University of England, the various &quot;Free&quot; universities, such as Heliotrope in San Francisco, the 20 branches of the University Without Walls all over the United States, the university extension programs, which gear their courses entirely to working people - they are all examples of institutions experimenting with different aspects of the marketplace idea.","sm_api_keyword_array":["university","marketplace","course","building","idea"]}
