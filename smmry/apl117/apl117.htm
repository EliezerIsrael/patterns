{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"117 SHELTERING ROOF","sm_api_content":" Slope the roof or make a vault of it, make its entire surface visible, and bring the eaves of the roof down low, as low as 6&#039;0&quot; or 6&#039;6&quot; at places like the entrance, where people pause. Build the top story of each wing right into the roof, so that the roof does not only cover it, but actually surrounds it. In one study, the importance of images - i.e., symbols - for house form is stressed, and the pitched roof is said to be symbolic of shelter while the flat roof is not, and is therefore unacceptable on symbolic grounds. Despite 50 years of the flat roofs of the &quot;Modern movement,&quot; people still find the simple pitched roof the most powerful symbol of shelter. Get the exact shape of the cross section from ROOF VAULTS ; use the space inside the top of the sloped roof for BULK STORAGE; where the roof comes down low, perhaps make it continuous with an ARCADE or GALLERY SURROUND. Build the roof flat, not sloped, only where people can get out to it to use it as a garden - ROOF GARDENS; where rooms are built into the roof, make windows in the roof - DORMER WINDOWS - If the building plan is complex, get the exact way that different sloped roofs meet from ROOF LAYOUT.","sm_api_keyword_array":["roof","Build","shelter","people","pitched"]}
