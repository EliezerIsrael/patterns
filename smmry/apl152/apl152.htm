{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"152 HALF-PRIVATE OFFICE","sm_api_content":" Within the overall arrangement of group space and individual working space provided by INTIMACY GRADIENT, FLEXIBLE OFFICE SPACE, and SMALL WORK GROUPS, this pattern shapes the individual rooms and offices. What is the right balance between privacy and connection in office work?. The totally private office has a devastating effect on the flow of human relationships within a work group, and entrenches the ugly quality of office hierarchies. Everyone who has experienced office work reports some version of this problem. The workings of the group became formalized; easy-going communication vanished; the entire atmosphere changed from a setting which sustained our growth as a group to an office bureaucracy, where people made appointments with each other, left notes in special boxes, and nervously knocked on each other&#039;s doors. As we thought it out, it seemed that almost every place where we had found ourselves working well together had these characteristics: no office was entirely private; most offices were for more than one person; but even when an office was only for one, it had a kind of simple common area at its front and everyone felt free to drop in and stay for a moment.","sm_api_keyword_array":["WORK","OFFICE","group","door","ROOM"]}
