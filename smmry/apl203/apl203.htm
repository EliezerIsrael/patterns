Wherever children play, around the house, in the neighborhood, in schools, make small &quot;Caves&quot; for them. Tuck these caves away in natural left over spaces, under stairs, under kitchen counters. In the course of their play, young children seek out cave-like spaces to get into and under-old crates, under tables, in tents, etc. When children are playing in such a &quot;Cave&quot; - each child takes up about 5 square feet; furthermore, children like to do this in groups, so the caves should be large enough to accommodate this: these sorts of groups range in size from three to five - so is to 25 square feet, plus about 15 square feet for games and circulation, gives a rough maximum size for caves. Make the doors very tiny to match the caves - an extreme version of LOW DOORWAY....","sm_api_keyword_array":["Cave","children","feet","play","under"]}
