{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"235 SOFT INSIDE WALLS","sm_api_content":" If it is possible to use a soft material for the inner sheet of the wall membrane, then the wall will have the right character built in from the beginning. A wall which is too hard or too cold or too solid is unpleasant to touch; it makes decoration impossible, and creates hollow echoes. In general, we have found that modern construction has gone more and more toward materials for inside walls that are hard and smooth. Walls finished in wood have the quality - the wood itself has texture; boards repeat it at a larger scale. The walls are plastered, by hand, with a mixture of cow dung and mud, which dries to a beautiful soft finish and shows the five fingers of the plasterer&#039;s hand all over the walls. In our own building system, we find it is worth putting on a light skim coat of plaster over the inner surfaces of the WALL MEMBRANE and FLOOR-CEILING VAULTS.","sm_api_keyword_array":["WALL","hard","plaster","use","material"]}
