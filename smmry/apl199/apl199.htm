{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"199 SUNNY COUNTER","sm_api_content":" To help create these larger patterns, and to make the kitchen as warm and beautiful as possible, it is worth taking a great deal of care placing the counter and its windows. The kitchen needs the sun more than the other rooms, not less. Place the main part of the kitchen counter on the south and southeast side of the kitchen, with big windows around it, so that sun can flood in and fill the kitchen with yellow light both morning and afternoon. First, people often place kitchens to the north, because they reserve the south for living rooms and then put the kitchen in the left over areas. In many apartments, efficiency kitchens are even in positions where they get no natural light at all. Of course, the arguments we have presented in FARMHOUSE KITCHEN for making the kitchen a living room, not merely a machine-shop, change all this.","sm_api_keyword_array":["kitchen","window","light","Place","counter"]}
