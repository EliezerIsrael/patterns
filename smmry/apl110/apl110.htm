{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"110 MAIN ENTRANCE","sm_api_content":" Placing the main entrance is perhaps the single most important step you take during the evolution of a building plan. Place the main entrance of the building at a point where it can be seen immediately from the main avenues of approach and give it a bold, visible shape which stands out in front of the building. When the entrances are placed correctly, the layout of the building unfolds naturally and simply; when the entrances are badly placed, the rest of the building never seems quite right. The entrance must be placed in such a way that people who approach the bulding see the entrance or some hint of where the entrance is, as soon as they see the building itself. Locate entrances so that, once the building(s) come into view, the entrance, too, comes into view; and the path toward the entrance is not more than 50 feet along the building. If possible, make the entrance one of a family of similar entrances, so that they all stand out as visibly as possible within the street or building complex - FAMILY OF ENTRANCES; build that part of the entrance which sticks out, as a room, large enough to be a pleasant, light, and beautiful place - ENTRANCE ROOM and bring the path between the street and this entrance room through a series of transitions of light and level and view - ENTRANCE TRANSITION.","sm_api_keyword_array":["entrance","build","Place","main","approach"]}
