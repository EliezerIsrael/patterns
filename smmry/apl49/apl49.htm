{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"49 LOOPED LOCAL ROADS","sm_api_content":" A loop is defined as any stretch of road which makes it impossible for cars that don&#039;t have destinations on it to use it as a shortcut. Do not allow any one loop to serve more than 50 cars, and keep the road really narrow - 17 to 20 feet is quite enough. &quot; We define a looped road as any road in a road network so placed that no path along other roads in the road network can be shortened by travel along the &quot;loop. The loops themselves must be designed to discourage high volumes or high speeds: this depends on the total number of houses served by the loop, the road surface, the road width, and the number of curves and corners. A way of closing streets to form looped local roads. Make all the junctions between local roads three-way T junctions, never four-way intersections - T JUNCTIONS; wherever there is any possibility of life from buildings being oriented toward the road, give the road a very rough surface of grass and gravel, with paving stones for wheels of cars - GREEN STREETS; keep parking off the road in driveways - SMALL PARKING LOTS and CAR CONNECTION; except where the roads are very quiet, run pedestrian paths at right angles to them, not along them, and make buildings open off these paths, not off the roads - NETWORK OF PATHS AND CARS....","sm_api_keyword_array":["road","loop","house","car","path"]}
