{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"73 ADVENTURE PLAYGROUND","sm_api_content":" Inside the local neighborhood, even if there is common land where children can meet and play - COMMON LAND, CONNECTED PLAY; it is essential that there be at least one smaller part, which is differentiated, where the play is wilder, and where the children have access to all kinds of junk. Set up a playground for the children in each neighborhood. Not a highly finished playground, with asphalt and swings, but a place with raw materials of all kinds - nets, boxes, barrels, trees, ropes, simple tools, frames, grass, and water - where children can create and re-create playgrounds of their own. Play has many functions: it gives children a chance to be together, a chance to use their bodies, to build muscles, and to test new skills. Children come to terms with the world, wrestle with their pictures of it, and reform these pictures constantly, through those adventures of imagination we call play. Any kind of playground which disturbs, or reduces, the role of imagination and makes the child more passive, more the recipient of someone else&#039;s imagination, may look nice, may be clean, may be safe, may be healthy - but it just cannot satisfy the fundamental need which play is all about.","sm_api_keyword_array":["children","play","playground","where","imagination"]}
