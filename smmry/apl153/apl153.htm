{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"153 ROOMS TO RENT","sm_api_content":" As the life in a building changes, the need for space shrinks and swells cyclically. Make at least some part of the building rentable: give it a private entrance over and above its regular connection to the rest of the house. The rooms which are given to outside use or let out when they are not used, may one day be needed again when circumstances change and the workgroup or family swells in size again. In effect, some rooms should be conceived in advance as potential rooms to let if the size of the group should change. These rooms need a kind of connection to the rest of the house, which allows them to be closed off and separated, and then, just as easily, joined up again. Place the rooms to rent in such a way that they can double as a TEENAGER&#039;S COTTAGE, or an OLD AGE COTTAGE, or a HOME WORKSHOPO; give the private entrance an ENTRANCE TRANSITION, and if the space is on an upper floor, give it direct access to the street by means of OPEN STAIRS.","sm_api_keyword_array":["room","SPACE","building","house","rent"]}
