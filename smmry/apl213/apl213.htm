{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"213 FINAL COLUMN DISTRIBUTION","sm_api_content":" Adjust them so they are evenly spaced between each pair of corner columns; but on any one floor, make sure that they are closer together along the walls of small rooms and further apart along the walls of large rooms. If we assume that the walls all have the same height, then the four walls will therefore have progressively greater and greater slenderness ratios, and will therefore fall further and further to the left on the curve, and will therefore need to be stiffened at closer and closer intervals. Suppose a four story building has 8 foot high walls on all floors and has wall thicknesses of 12 inches, 9 inches, 6 inches, and 3 inches on its four floors. Make wall thicknesses and column thicknesses vary with the height - see WALL MEMBRANE. Column thicknesses must be proportional to wall thicknesses, so that the thinnest walls have the thinnest columns. If the walls are thick, they will need to be full columns, twice as thick as the walls, and roughly square in section, built before the walls, but made in such a way that they can be poured integrally with the walls - BOX COLUMNS....","sm_api_keyword_array":["wall","stiffener","column","floor","room"]}
