{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"68 CONNECTED PLAY","sm_api_content":" If children don&#039;t play enough with other children during the first five years of life, there is a great chance that they will have some kind of mental illness later in their lives. Parents, afraid of traffic or of their neighbors, keep their small children indoors or in their own gardens: so the children never have enough chance meetings with other children of their own age to form the groups which are essential to a healthy emotional development. We shall show that children will only be able to have the access to other children which they need, if each household opens onto some kind of safe, connected common land, which touches at least 64 other households. On the positive side, an informal account by Anna Freud shows how powerful the effect of contact among tiny children can be on the emotional development of the children. The answer, we believe, is some form of safe common land, connected to a child&#039;s home, and from which he can make contact with several other children. Let us assume that children represent about one-fourth of a given population, and that these children are evenly distributed in age from 0 to 18.","sm_api_keyword_array":["children","land","play","household","connect"]}
