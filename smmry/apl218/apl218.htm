{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"218 WALL MEMBRANE","sm_api_content":" According to EFFICIENT STRUCTURE and FINAL COLUMN DISTRIBUTION, the wall is a compressive loadbearing membrane, &quot;Stretched&quot; between adjacent columns and continuous with them, the columns themselves placed at frequent intervals to act as stiffeners. Build the wall as a membrane which connects the columns and door frames and windows frames and is, at least in part, continuous with them. To build the wall, first put up an inner and an outer membrane, which can function as a finished surface; then pour the fill into the wall. When walls are working like this, they are essentially structural membranes: they are continuous in two dimensions; together with stiffeners and columns they resist loads in compression; and they create a continuous rigid connection between columns, beams, and floors, both above and below, to help resist shear and bending. By contrast, curtain walls and walls which are essentially &quot;Infill,&quot; do not act as membranes. The wall is built by fixing nailing blocks to the sides of columns.","sm_api_keyword_array":["wall","COLUMN","membrane","skin","concrete"]}
