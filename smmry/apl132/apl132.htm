{"sm_api_message":"","sm_api_title":"132 SHORT PASSAGES","sm_api_content":" THE FLOW THROUGH ROOMS describes the generosity of light and movement in the way that rooms connect to one another and recommends against the use of passages. When there has to be a passage in an office or a house and when it is too small to be a BUILDING THOROUGHFARE, it must be treated very specially, as if it were itself a room. The ugly long repetitive corridors of the machine age have so far infected the word &quot;Corridor&quot; that it is hard to imagine that a corridor could ever be a place of beauty, a moment in your passage from room to room, which means as much as all the moments you spend in the rooms themselves. The second issue is the relation of the passage to the rooms which open off it. Put in windows, bookshelves, and furnishings to make them as much like actual rooms as possible, with alcoves, seats along the edge - LIGHT ON TWO SIDES OF EVERY ROOM, ALCOVES, WINDOW PLACE, THICK WALLS, CLOSETS BETWEEN ROOMS; open up the long side into the garden or out onto balconies - OUTDOOR ROOM, GALLERY SURROUND, LOW SILL. Make interior windows between the passage and the rooms which open off it - INTERIOR WINDOWS, SOLID DOORS WITH GLASS.","sm_api_keyword_array":["room","passage","Corridor","long","WINDOW"]}
